    						MediaNews Group, based in Denver, Colorado, is one of the largest newspaper companies in the United States. It is privately owned and operates 56 daily newspapers in 12 states, with combined daily and Sunday circulation of approximately 2.4 million and 2.7 million, respectively. The company also owns KTVA, a CBS affiliate in Anchorage, Alaska, and radio stations in Texas.
The company&#39;s executive board chairman is founder William Dean Singleton, previously CEO. The president Jody Lodovic recently resigned.
Singleton founded MediaNews Group in 1983. Singleton was a pioneer in &quot;clustering&quot;—developing groups of newspapers that centralized a variety of functions, including production, ad sales, business operations and, in some cases, editorial. An example of this was the Alameda Newspaper Group in suburban San Francisco, where in the mid-1990s, a central newsroom in Pleasanton, California, did all the copy editing, layout and page makeup for five daily papers. Upon acquiring the diverse group of papers, Singleton consolidated several news sections (such as sports and features) to one local office away from the metropolitan area, having a few reporters do the job of what had been many

    						The Herald and Weekly Times Limited (HWT) is a newspaper publishing company based in Melbourne, Australia. It is owned and operated by Rupert Murdoch&#39;s News Limited, who purchased HWT in 1987.
The HWT publishes the morning daily tabloid Herald Sun, which was created in 1990 from a merger of the company&#39;s morning tabloid paper, The Sun News-Pictorial, with its afternoon broadsheet paper, The Herald. These mastheads had been publishing as separate papers since 1840 (The Herald) and 1922 (The Sun News-Pictorial); HWT had bought The Sun News-Pictorial in 1925.
The HWT also publishes The Weekly Times, aimed at farmers and rural business.
HWT bought a controlling stake in The Advertiser of Adelaide in 1929. The Advertiser took a stake in The News two years later. The News was sold in 1949.
HWT bought The West Australian in 1969, but sold it to Robert Holmes à Court in 1987 as part of the News Limited takeover.

Scioli was born in Villa Crespo, Buenos Aires. He spent his first years in a typical middle class home located at the corner of Corrientes and Humboldt. His grandfather ran an electrical hardware store, which over time grew into a store selling electrical appliances that was to become the family business. Scioli has described himself as a loyal man devoted to his stable and intimate circle, and an understanding but demanding father.
He is married to former model and entrepreneur Karina Rabolini and has a daughter called Lorena, who was accepted by Scioli as his daughter when she was 18 years old. Regarding this issue, he says, &quot;It helped me to grow and to give me peace of mind. My relation with Lorena improved my life, and that’s why now I can also enjoy Father’s Day&quot;.
Scioli attended Colegio Ward’s primary school in Villa Sarmiento, where he lived until he was 17 years old. For his secondary schooling, he graduated from the Escuela
