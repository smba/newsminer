A strategy of generous consumer credit, low prices, and high volume allowed Spiegel to accomplish the remarkable feat of expanding its operations during the Great Depression.In 1982, Spiegel was bought by Michael Otto, who took it public in 1987.

Spiegel eventually became one of the most important firms in the mail-order industry, and arguably the first. In 1904, Joseph and his son, Arthur, switched to mail order. Spiegel mailed its first catalog in 1905. By 1925, it had 10 million customers. Before the Great Depression began, Spiegel (which then sold women&amp;lsquo;s&amp;lsquo; clothing as well as furniture) was selling over $20 million yearly through the mail. A strategy of generous consumer credit, low prices, and high volume allowed Spiegel to accomplish the remarkable feat of expanding its operations during the Great Depression.In 1982, Spiegel was bought by Michael Otto, who took it public in 1987.

    						The National Security Agency (NSA) is a cryptologic intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the collection and analysis of foreign communications and foreign signals intelligence, as well as protecting U.S. government communications and information systems, which involves information security and cryptanalysis/cryptography.
The NSA is directed by at least a lieutenant general or vice admiral. NSA is a key component of the U.S. Intelligence Community, which is headed by the Director of National Intelligence. The Central Security Service is a co-located agency created to coordinate intelligence activities and co-operation between NSA and other U.S. military cryptanalysis agencies. The Director of the National Security Agency serves as the Commander of the United States Cyber Command and Chief of the Central Security Service.
By law, NSA&#39;s intelligence gathering is limited to foreign communications, although domestic incidents such as the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy have occurred.
The National Security Agency&#39;s predecessor was the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA), created on May 20, 1949. This organization was originally

Based in Cheltenham, it operates under the guidance of the Joint Intelligence Committee.
GCHQ was originally established after the First World War as the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS or GC&amp;CS), by which name it was known until 1946. During the Second World War it was located at Bletchley Park.
GCHQ is the responsibility of the UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, but it is not a part of the Foreign Office, and its Director ranks as a Permanent Secretary.
CESG (originally Communications-Electronics Security Group) is the branch of GCHQ which works to secure the communications and information systems of the government and critical parts of UK national infrastructure.

    						Alecia Beth Moore (born September 8, 1979), better known by her stage name Pink (often stylized as P!nk), is an American singer-songwriter, musician and actress. After her three-year career with the contemporary R&amp;B girl group Choice, in 2000 she released her first single &quot;There You Go,&quot; from her debut album Can&#39;t Take Me Home. The song garnered commercial success, peaking at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2001, she released her second, more pop rock-oriented, studio album, Missundaztood. The album went on to become a critical and commercial success, with estimated sales of 13 million. The album produced four singles, &quot;Get the Party Started,&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t Let Me Get Me,&quot; &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot; and &quot;Family Portrait,&quot; each entering the Top 20, with &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; being her highest charting solo single (tied with &quot;Most Girls&quot;) until &quot;So What&quot; in 2008, peaking at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.
In November 2003, Pink released her third album Try This. The album was, commercially, less successful than her previous album, but still managed to sell around 3 million copies, making it Pink&#39;s least successful album to date. It produced three singles, &quot;Trouble,&quot; &quot;God Is a DJ&quot; and &quot;Last to Know,&quot;

    						Deutsche Telekom AG (abbreviated DTAG, English: German Telecom) is a German telecommunications company headquartered in Bonn, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is the largest telecommunications company in Europe. Deutsche Telekom was formed in 1996 as the former state-owned monopoly Deutsche Bundespost was privatized. As of June 2008, the German government still holds a 15% stake in company stock directly, and another 17% through the government bank KfW.
The former CEO Kai-Uwe Ricke was ousted by the board of the company because of slumping sales and the flight of customers to cheaper competitors. More than 1.5 million customers changed to rival companies during 2005 and 2006 and as a result, Deutsche Telekom laid off more than 30,000 workers. The new CEO was announced on November 12, 2006 after a long-night board session: René Obermann, the former CEO of T-Mobile International.
The predecessor of Ricke, Ron Sommer, chairman of Deutsche Telekom between 1995 and 2002, was ousted because of the drop in the share price of the company in 2002. At the height of the dot-com bubble, the share was valued at over €100 but fell significantly to about €12/share during a couple of months.
