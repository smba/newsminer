					Education with a debt sentence<br />For-profit colleges as American dream drushers and factories of debt<br />22 September, by Hannah Appel and  Astra Taylor<br />Imagine corporations that intentionally target low-income single mothers as ideal customers. Imagine that these same companies claim to sell tickets to the American dream — gainful employment, the chance for a middle class life. Imagine that the fine print on these tickets, once purchased, reveals them to be little more than debt contracts, profitable to the corporation’s investors, but disastrous for its customers. And imagine that these corporations receive tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to do this dirty work. Now, know that these corporations actually exist and are universities.<br />Over the last three decades, the price of a year of college has increased by more than 1,200% . In the past, American higher education has always been associated with upward mobility, but with student loan debt quadrupling between 2003 and 2013, it’s time to ask whether education alone can really move people up the class ladder.

These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell&amp;lsquo;s motto, a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: &quot;I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.&quot;The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy.

An exceptional military leader, his victories over the French at the Battles of Crécy and Poitiers made him very popular during his lifetime. In 1348 he became the first Knight of the Garter, of whose Order he was one of the founders.Edward died one year before his father, becoming the first English Prince of Wales not to become King of England.

All three are concerned with generating revenue, but only the for-profit model exists primarily to enrich its owners. The largest of these institutions are often publicly traded, nationally franchised corporations legally beholden to maximize profit for their shareholders before maximizing education for their students. While commercial vocational programs have existed since the nineteenth century, for-profit colleges in their current form are a relatively new phenomenon that began to boom with a series of initial public offerings in the 1990s, followed quickly by deregulation of the sector as the millennium approached. <a href='201.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','George W.

The term Ivy League also has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.The term became official after the formation of the NCAA Division I athletic conference in 1954. The use of the phrase is no longer limited to athletics, and now represents an educational philosophy inherent to the nation&amp;lsquo;s oldest schools.

The fact is that for-profits like Corinthian exemplify all the contradictions of the free-market model that reformers present as the only solution to the current crisis in higher education: not only are these schools 90% dependent on taxpayer money, but tenure doesn’t exist, there are no faculty unions, most courses are offered online with low overhead costs, and students are treated as “customers.”<br />It’s also worth remembering that at “public” universities, it is now nearly impossible for working class or even middle class students to graduate without debt. This sad state of affairs — so the common version of the story goes — is the consequence of economic hard-times, which require belt tightening and budget cuts. And so it has come to pass that strapped community colleges are now turning away would-be enrollees who wind up in the embrace of for-profits that proceed to squeeze every penny they can from them and the public purse as well. (All the while, of course, this same tale provides for-profits with a cover: they are offering a public service to a marginalized and needy population no one else will touch.)<br />The standard narrative that, in the face of shrinking tax revenues, public universities must relentlessly raise tuition rates turns out, however, to be full of holes. As political theorist Robert Meister points out, this version of the story ignores the complicity of university leaders in the process. Many of them were never passive victims of privatization; instead, they saw tuition, not taxpayer funding, as the superior and preferred form of revenue growth.<br />Beginning in the 1990s, universities, public and private, began working ever more closely with Wall Street, which meant using tuition payments not just as direct revenue but also as collateral for debt-financing.

This allowed the Rolling Jubilee project to make a multi-million dollar impact with a budget of approximately $700,000 raised in large part through small individual donations.<br />The point of the Rolling Jubilee is simple enough: we believe people shouldn’t have to go into debt for basic needs. For the last four decades, easy access to credit has masked stagnating wages and crumbling social services, forcing many Americans to debt-finance necessities like college, health care, and housing, while the creditor class has reaped enormous rewards.

Nathan wrote histories of the reigns of both David and of Solomon (see 1 Chronicles 29:29 and 2 Chronicles 9:29), and was involved in the music of the temple (see 2 Chronicles 29:25).In 1 Kings 1:8-45 it is Nathan who tells the dying David of the plot of Adonijah to become king, resulting in Solomon being proclaimed king instead.The feast day of Nathan the Prophet is on 24 October. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, he is commemorated as a saint on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (i.e., the Sunday before the Great Feast of the Nativity of the Lord).King David named one of his sons after the prophet.

Thus, <a href='201.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Methodist Church of Great Britain');changeContent('custom-widget-description','The Methodist Church of Great Britain (or simply The Methodist Church) is the largest Wesleyan Methodist body in the United Kingdom, with congregations across Great Britain (although more limited in Scotland). It is the United Kingdom&amp;lsquo;s fourth largest Christian denomination, with around 300,000 members and 6,000 churches. Congregations in the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, Malta and Gibraltar also form part of the British Methodist Church. According to historians such as Elie Halevy, Eric J. Hobsbawm and E. P. Thompson, Methodism had a major impact in the early decades of the making of the English working class (1760–1820).Methodism arose as a revival movement in the 18th century, largely within the Church of England.The main Methodist movement outside the Church of England was associated with Howell Harris in Wales. This was to become The Calvinistic Methodist Church. Another branch of the Methodist revival was under the ministry of Rev. George Whitfield, resulting in the Countess of Huntingdon&amp;lsquo;s Connexion. A later development of Whitfield&amp;lsquo;s ministry was the Free Church of England, a result of Whitfield&amp;lsquo;s influence upon the Church of England.The largest branch of Methodism');">Methodist Church of Great Britain</a> ministers must have bought up lots of rum in that time period!<br />Actually no, that’s a silly conclusion to draw. What’s really going on is that both quantities — Methodist ministers and Cuban rum — were driven upwards by other factors, such as population growth.<br />In reaching that incorrect conclusion, we’ve made the far-too-common mistake of confusing correlation with causation.<br />Two quantities are said to be correlated if both increase and decrease together (“positively correlated”), or if one increases when the other decreases and vice-versa (“negatively correlated”).<br />Correlation is readily detected through statistical measurements of the <a href='201.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Lester B. Pearson');changeContent('custom-widget-description','Lester Bowles &quot;Mike&quot; Pearson, PC, OM, CC, OBE (23 April 1897 – 27 December 1972) was a Canadian professor, historian, civil servant, statesman, diplomat, and politician, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for organizing the United Nations Emergency Force to resolve the Suez Canal Crisis. He was the 14th Prime Minister of Canada from 22 April 1963 to 20 April 1968, as the head of two back-to-back minority governments following elections in 1963 and 1965.During Pearson&amp;lsquo;s time as Prime Minister, his minority government introduced universal health care, student loans, the Canada Pension Plan, the Order of Canada, and the current Canadian flag. During his tenure, Prime Minister Pearson also convened the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. With these accomplishments, together with his ground-breaking work at the United Nations and in international diplomacy, Pearson is generally considered among the most influential Canadians of the 20th century.Pearson was born in the town of Newtonbrook (now part of Toronto), the son of Annie Sarah (née Bowles) and Edwin Arthur Pearson, a Methodist (later United Church of Canada) minister. He was brother to Vaughan Whitier Pearson');">Lester B. Pearson</a>’s correlation coefficient, which indicates how tightly locked together the two quantities are, ranging from -1 (perfectly negatively correlated) through 0 (not at all correlated) and up to 1 (perfectly positively correlated).<br />But just because two quantities are correlated does not necessarily mean that one is directly causing the other to change. Correlation does not imply causation, just like cloudy weather does not imply rainfall, even though the reverse is true. If two quantities are correlated then there might well be a genuine cause-and-effect relationship (such as rainfall levels and umbrella sales), but maybe other variables are driving both (such as pirate numbers and global warming), or perhaps it’s just coincidence (such as <a href='201.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:4'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='37.09024,-95.712891'>United States of America</a> cheese consumption and strangulations-by-bedsheet).<br />Even where causation is present, we must be careful not to mix up the cause with the effect, or else we might conclude, for example, that an increased use of heaters causes colder weather.<br />In order to establish cause-and-effect, we need to go beyond the statistics and look for separate evidence (of a scientific or historical nature) and logical reasoning. Correlation may prompt us to go looking for such evidence in the first place, but it is by no means a proof in its own right.<br />Although the above examples were obviously silly, correlation is very often mistaken for causation in ways that are not immediately obvious in the real world. When reading and interpreting statistics, one must take great care to understand exactly what the data and its statistics are implying — and more importantly, what they are not implying.<br />One recent example of the need for caution in interpreting data is the excitement earlier this year surrounding the apparent groundbreaking detection of gravitational waves — an announcement that appears to have been made prematurely, before all the variables that were affecting the data were accounted for.<br />Unfortunately, analysing statistics, probabilities and risks is not a skill set wired into our human intuition, and so is all too easy to be led astray. Entire books have been written on the subtle ways in which statistics can be misinterpreted (or used to mislead). To help keep your guard up, here are some common slippery statistical problems that you should be aware of:<br />1) The Healthy Worker Effect, where sometimes two groups cannot be directly compared on a level playing field.<br />Consider a hypothetical study comparing the health of a group of office-workers with the health of a group of astronauts. If the study shows no significant difference between the two — no correlation between healthiness and working environment — are we to conclude that living and working in space carries no long-term health risks for astronauts?<br />No! The groups are not on the same footing: the astronaut corps screen applicants to find healthy candidates, who then maintain a comprehensive fitness regime in order to proactively combat the effects of living in “microgravity.”<br />We would therefore expect them to be significant healthier than office workers, on average, and should rightly be concerned if they were not.<br />2) Categorization and the Stage Migration Effect — shuffling people between groups can have dramatic effects on statistical outcomes. This is also known as the Will Rogers effect, after the <a href='201.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:5'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='37.09024,-95.712891'>United States of America</a> comedian who reportedly quipped:<br />“When the Okies left <a href='201.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:6'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='35.4675602,-97.5164276'>Oklahoma</a> and moved to <a href='201.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:7'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='36.778261,-119.4179324'>California</a>, they raised the average intelligence level in both states.”<br />To illustrate, imagine dividing a large group of friends into a “short” group and a “tall” group (perhaps in order to arrange them for a photo). Having done so, it’s surprisingly easy to raise the average height of both groups at once.<br />Simply ask the shortest person in the “tall” group to switch over to the “short” group. The “tall”‘ group lose their shortest member, thus bumping up their average height — but the “short” group gain their tallest member yet, and thus also gain in average height.<br />This has major implications in medical studies, where patients are often sorted into “healthy” or “unhealthy” groups in the course of testing a new treatment. If diagnostic methods improve, some very-slightly-unhealthy patients may be recategorized — leading to the health outcomes of both groups improving, regardless of how effective (or not) the treatment is.<br />3) Data mining — when an abundance of data is present, bits and pieces can be cherry-picked to support any desired conclusion. This is bad statistical practice, but if done deliberately can be hard to spot without knowledge of the original, complete data set.<br />Consider fluoride, for instance — in small amounts it is one of the most effective preventative medicines in history, but the positive effect disappears entirely if one only ever considers toxic quantities of fluoride. For similar reasons, it is important that the procedures for a given statistical experiment are fixed in place before the experiment begins and then remain unchanged until the experiment ends.<br />4) Clustering — which is to be expected even in completely random data.<br />Consider a medical study examining how a particular disease, such as cancer or Multiple sclerosis, is geographically distributed. If the disease strikes at random (and the environment has no effect) we would expect to see numerous clusters of patients as a matter of course. If patients are spread out perfectly evenly, the distribution would be most un-random indeed! So the presence of a single cluster, or a number of small clusters of cases, is entirely normal. Sophisticated statistical methods are needed to determine just how much clustering is required to deduce that something in that area might be causing the illness.<br />Unfortunately, any cluster at all — even a non-significant one — makes for an easy (and at first glance, compelling) news headline. Statistical analysis, like any other powerful tool, must be used very carefully — and in particular, one must always be careful when drawing conclusions based on the fact that two quantities are correlated.<br />Instead, we must always insist on separate evidence to argue for cause-and-effect — and that evidence will not come in the form of a single statistical number.<br />Seemingly compelling correlations, say between given genes and schizophrenia or between a high fat diet and heart disease, may turn out to be based on very dubious methodology.<br />We are perhaps as a species cognitively ill prepared to deal with these issues. As Canadian educator Kieran Egan put it in his book “Getting It Wrong From the Beginning”:<br />“The bad news is that our evolution equipped us to live in small, stable, hunter-gatherer societies. We are Pleistocene people, but our languaged brains have created massive, multicultural, technologically sophisticated and rapidly changing societies for us to live in.” In consequence, we must constantly resist the temptation to see meaning in chance and to confuse correlation and causation.<br />Jonathan Borwein (<a href='201.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Lil Jon');changeContent('custom-widget-description','Jonathan Smith (born January 27, 1971), better known by his stage name Lil Jon, is an American rapper, music producer, entrepreneur, and international DJ who was a member of the group Lil Jon &amp; The East Side Boyz.

					Producer Blog: Tapping into the brain's potential<br />Our producer surveys the promising uses of transcranial direct current stimulation<br />September 23, 2014 4:00PM ET<br />by Joanne Shen @theonlyjshen<br />Let’s face it: the notion of applying electricity to the brain gets a bad rap. There are two popular images of this scenario seared into our collective imagination: the Frankenstein monster coming to life with a jolt of electricity and, more recently, <a href='201.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Jack Nicholson');changeContent('custom-widget-description','John Joseph &quot;Jack&quot; Nicholson (born April 22, 1937) is an American actor, film director, producer, and writer. He is renowned for his often dark portrayals of neurotic characters. His twelve Oscar nominations make him the second most nominated actor of all time, behind only Meryl Streep, and tied with Katharine Hepburn.Nicholson has been nominated for an Academy Award twelve times and has won the Academy Award for Best Actor twice: for One Flew Over the Cuckoo&amp;lsquo;s Nest and for As Good as It Gets. He also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the 1983 film Terms of Endearment. He is tied with Walter Brennan for most acting wins by a male actor (three). Nicholson is well known for playing villainous roles such as Jack Torrance in The Shining, Frank Costello in The Departed, and the Joker in 1989&amp;lsquo;s Batman, among many other roles.Nicholson is one of only two actors who have been nominated for an Academy Award for acting in every decade from the 1960s to 2000s; the other is Michael Caine. He has won seven Golden Globe Awards, and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. In 1994, he became one of the youngest actors to be awarded the American Film Institute&amp;lsquo;s Life');">Jack Nicholson</a> in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest who is forced into electroshock therapy. Let’s just say he lost his joie de vivre.<br />That’s why when I told people, "I’m working on a story about a form of therapy that involves placing electrodes on the head," I got a range of reactions — from looks of disbelief to downright aghast faces.<br />The therapy is called transcranial direct current stimulation or TDCS and it actually only involves about 1/400th of the amount of current applied in electroshock therapy. The amount is so small that some people don’t discern anything while others have described a slight tingling, itching or burning. In other words, no convulsing, foaming at the mouth or involuntary twitching of the body.<br />There is a lot of buzz about it lately in neuroscience circles with a growing number of studies using TDCS to treat a range of illnesses from schizophrenia, depression, to forms of brain damage caused by strokes.<br />TDCS works by placing a positive electrode and a negative electrode to specific parts of the brain. When the TDCS device is turned on, the current makes its way through the scalp, affecting the brain region beneath. The current is too small to actually make the neurons fire but, depending on the type of stimulation, it’s just enough to either enhance or diminish their natural ability to fire.<br />The therapeutic applications of TDCS are currently being tested in clinical trials around the world. Some of the most promising studies involve depression, including one in <a href='201.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:1'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-14.235004,-51.92528'>Brazil</a> , which is comparing the effects of Zoloft against TDCS. Researchers hope that TDCS as an “electroceutical” might be an alternative to pharmaceuticals which often have side effects. Or TDCS might be simply used on patients whose depression can’t be treated by medications.<br />But it’s not just those with serious mood disorders or mental illnesses who might benefit from TDCS. (Here’s the part in the conversation in which those who pooh-pooh the idea of zapping the brain usually sit up and take notice.) There are studies looking at how TDCS could help you lose weight . Yup, apparently if you dial up the neuronal activity in the brain associated with rational decision making, you might not reach for that bag of potato chips.

The military apparently would like sleep-deprived soldiers to maintain their vigilance without trigger-happy jitters.

He came to David to reprimand him over his committing adultery with Bathsheba while she was the wife of Uriah the Hittite whose death the King had also arranged to hide his previous transgression.
His actions are described in the Books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles (see especially, 2 Samuel 7:2-17, 12:1-25.) Nathan wrote histories of the reigns of both David and of Solomon (see 1 Chronicles 29:29 and 2 Chronicles 9:29), and was involved in the music of the temple (see 2 Chronicles 29:25).
In 1 Kings 1:8-45 it is Nathan who tells the dying David of the plot of Adonijah to become king, resulting in Solomon being proclaimed king instead.
The feast day of Nathan the Prophet is on 24 October. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, he is commemorated as a saint on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (i.e., the Sunday before the Great Feast of the Nativity of the Lord).
King David named one of his sons after the prophet. The third of four sons born to David and Bathsheba
