Airbus employs around 52,000 people at sixteen sites in four European Union countries: France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain.

He was replaced by one of his generals, Suharto (see Transition to the New Order), and remained under house arrest until his death.The spelling &quot;Sukarno&quot; is frequently used in English as it is based on the newer official spelling in Indonesia since 1947 but the older spelling Soekarno, based on Dutch orthography, is still frequently used, mainly because he signed his name in the old spelling. Official Indonesian presidential decrees from the period 1947–1968, however, printed his name using the 1947 spelling. The Soekarno–Hatta International Airport which serves near Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia for example, still uses the older spelling.Indonesians also remember him as Bung Karno or Pak Karno.

The British Airways Board was established in 1971 to control the two nationalised airline corporations, BOAC and BEA, and two smaller, regional airlines, Cambrian Airways, from Cardiff, and Northeast Airlines, from Newcastle upon Tyne. On 31 March 1974, all four companies were merged to form British Airways.
