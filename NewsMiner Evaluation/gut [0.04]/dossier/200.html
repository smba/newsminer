This could create hundreds of jobs, but what is missing is "a decent road infrastructure to make our investment worthwhile," says Hundsdörfer. His trucks are forced to use Hollenbacher Steige, a crumbling road urgently in need of repaving. Often, trucks coming from opposite directions can't pass each other on the narrow road.<br />The road construction project would cost 3.48 million, but state and local governments have been hesitant to move forward for years, citing costs. For Hundsdörfer, the numbers simply don't add up. "We pay more in commercial tax each year than the road would cost to build." Now Hundsdörfer is considering the previously unthinkable: Why not build the logistics center abroad? Hundsdörfer wouldn't be alone in making that choice.<br />Decreased Industrial Investment<br />The German economy has shied away from investment for years.

    						Aberdeen /æbərˈdiːn/ (Scots: Aiberdeen  listen (help·info); Scottish Gaelic: Obar Dheathain [ˈopər ˈʝɛhɪn]) is Scotland&#39;s third most populous city, one of Scotland&#39;s 32 local government council areas and the United Kingdom&#39;s 29th most populous city, with an official population estimate of 220,420.
Nicknames include the Granite City, the Grey City and the Silver City with the Golden Sands. During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries, Aberdeen&#39;s buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite, which can sparkle like silver due to their high mica contents. The city has a long, sandy coastline. Since the discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s, other nicknames have been the Oil Capital of Europe or the Energy Capital of Europe. The area around Aberdeen has been settled since at least 8,000 years ago, when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don.
Aberdeen received Royal Burgh status from King David I (1124–53), transforming the city economically. The city&#39;s two universities, the University of Aberdeen, founded in 1495, and The Robert Gordon University, which was awarded university status in 1992, make Aberdeen the educational centre of the north-east.

    						Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (born 5 February 1992), commonly known simply as Neymar (Portuguese pronunciation: [nejˈmaʁ]) or Neymar Júnior, is a Brazilian footballer who plays in the Brasileirão Série A for Santos and the Brazilian national football team, mainly as a forward.
On 30 December 2010, Neymar came third behind Andrés D&#39;Alessandro and Juan Sebastián Verón for the 2010 South American Footballer of the Year; however, a year later, on 31 December 2011, he won the 2011 South American Footballer of the Year award for the first time, by a record margin. Neymar received nominations for the FIFA Ballon d&#39;Or and FIFA Puskás Award in 2011, where he came 10th for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d&#39;Or award and won the 2011 FIFA Puskás Award for scoring a sensational solo goal in the Brasileirão Série A against Flamengo. He is known for his acceleration, speed, dribbling, finishing in front of goal and technical ability. His playing style has earned him critical acclaim, with fans, media and former player&#39;s drawing comparisons to FC Barcelona forward Lionel Messi and Brazil legend Pelé, who has declared Neymar as &quot;an excellent player&quot;.
Neymar joined Santos in 2003 and, after several years of

    						Dilma Vana Rousseff (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈdʒiwmɐ χuˈsɛf] born 14 December 1947) is the 36th and current President of Brazil. She is the first woman to hold the office. Prior to that, in 2005, she was also the first woman to become Chief of Staff to the President of Brazil, appointed by then President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
The daughter of a Bulgarian entrepreneur, Rousseff was raised in an upper middle class household in Belo Horizonte. She became a socialist during her youth, and following the 1964 coup d&#39;état joined various left-wing and Marxist urban guerrilla groups that fought against the military dictatorship. Rousseff was captured and jailed between 1970 and 1972 and reportedly tortured.
After her release, Rousseff rebuilt her life in Porto Alegre with Carlos Araújo, who would be her partner for 30 years. Both helped found the Democratic Labour Party (PDT) in Rio Grande do Sul, participating in several of the party&#39;s electoral campaigns. She became the Secretary of the Treasury of the city of Porto Alegre in the Alceu Collares administration, and later the Secretary of Energy of the State of Rio Grande do Sul under both Collares and Olívio Dutra administrations.
