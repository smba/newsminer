Spiegel eventually became one of the most important firms in the mail-order industry, and arguably the first. In 1904, Joseph and his son, Arthur, switched to mail order. Spiegel mailed its first catalog in 1905. By 1925, it had 10 million customers. Before the Great Depression began, Spiegel (which then sold women&amp;lsquo;s&amp;lsquo; clothing as well as furniture) was selling over $20 million yearly through the mail.

					So where are the conspirators and lackeys?<br />By Andrew Graham-Yooll<br />For the Herald<br />Mempo Giardinelli’s fatuous reference last Sunday to us being in a pre-coup state reflects his (and my) generational paranoia. To call hatred and resentment what is happening in part of Argentine society and in the badly done-by business community and their “trade union lackeys” is dated and trite barricade sloganeering , especially where the official line in publicity (it does not even grade as propaganda) is the prime promoter of partisan feelings.<br />In fact, it would seem reasonable that any government that has been in office for 11 years should attract a fair volume of lacerating language. That’s called democracy. It is also called political exhaustion in many places. Or does the Sunday columnist want a more silent, toadying and incompetent opposition (he swept through the lot, Pro, Socialists, Radicals) than the bewilderingly inefficient product that fills almost half of the national <a href='189.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Indian National Congress');changeContent('custom-widget-description','The Indian National Congress (abbreviated INC, and commonly known as the Congress) is one of the two major political parties in India, the other being the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It is the largest and one of the oldest democratic political parties in the world. The party&amp;lsquo;s modern liberal platform is largely considered center-left in the Indian political spectrum. Founded in 1885 by members of the occultist movement Theosophical Society—Allan Octavian Hume, Dadabhai Naoroji, Dinshaw Wacha, Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee, Surendranath Banerjee, Monomohun Ghose, Mahadev Govind Ranade and William Wedderburn—the Indian National Congress became the leader of the Indian Independence Movement, with over 15 million members and over 70 million participants in its struggle against British rule in India. After independence in 1947, it became the nation&amp;lsquo;s dominant political party, led by the Nehru-Gandhi family for the most part; major challenges for party leadership have only recently formed.In the 2009 general elections, the Congress emerged as the single largest party in the Lok Sabha, with 205 of its candidates getting elected to the 543-member house. Consequently it, along with a');">Indian National Congress</a>.<br />Doesn’t Mempo Giardinelli remember the “progressive” anger generated by <a href='189.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Carlos Menem');changeContent('custom-widget-description','Carlos Saúl Menem (born July 2, 1930) is an Argentine politician who was President of Argentina from 1989 to 1999. He is currently an Argentine National Senator for La Rioja Province.Carlos S. Menem was born in 1930 in Anillaco, a small town in the mountainous north of La Rioja Province, Argentina. An Arab Argentine, his parents were born in the town of Yabrud (part of the Ottoman Empire at the time, currently in southwestern Syria, near the border with Lebanon). As a young man, he joined his father as a traveling salesman dealing in feed and sundry items. Menem enrolled in the National University of Córdoba, and received the degree of &quot;Abogado&quot;, equivalent to a Bachelor of Laws, in 1955. As a Law student, he became a vocal Peronist, and after President Juan Perón&amp;lsquo;s overthrow that year, he was briefly incarcerated. He later joined the Peronist Party&amp;lsquo;s successor, the Justicialist Party, and was elected President of its La Rioja Province chapter, in 1983.Menem Carlos &quot;el patillas&quot; La Rioja in 1973, a prominent post that left him exposed after the overthrow of President Isabel Martínez de Perón in March 1976. Having been close to La Rioja Bishop Enrique Angelelli (a Third World');">Carlos Menem</a> in the nineties, “neo-liberalism” they called it, much the same as the disguised performance on stage now.  That decade ended in the election victory of the Alianza — a recipe for failure which he probably voted for and, to my regret, I certainly did. At times in his writing the columnist pretends an element of irony, but it hardly works very well.<br />My goodness, Mempo Giardinelli, the use of such remonstrance is 50 years old, quite empty of any political value or strength today. Are we to believe that the poor little Argentine administration, so bereft of any form of defence and incapable even of the saving grace that might be the recognition of its own mistakes is under international threat from hatred and resentment? It would have been more productive for the reading public if the column had made explicit allegations, or maybe just a little hint against specific “lackeys” and the leaders of local branches of Wall Street-based vulture funds hidden in our midst. The column would have been so much more credible.<br />If we are going to add our voices to the chorus claiming that we have lived in democracy since 1983, we should be able to understand due constitutional process and participation in the open political contest. We should not claim that democracy is practised only when our side wins and hence should be free of all questioning.<br />In many countries, from <a href='189.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:5'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='61.52401,105.318756'>Russia</a>, through <a href='189.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:6'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='54.5259614,15.2551187'>Europe</a>, to the <a href='189.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:7'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='37.09024,-95.712891'>United States of America</a> — well, no, let’s leave out the <a href='189.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:8'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='37.09024,-95.712891'>United States of America</a>, seeing as it claims to be the land of the free and has perhaps the largest prison population in the world — the business conspirators and crooks, and their lackeys, face charges and trial if caught.

The professional associations of doctors, paramedics and nurses are urging their members not to participate in executions.

    						The Islamic State of Iraq (ISI, Arabic: دولة العراق الإسلامية‎ Dawlat al-ʿIrāq al-ʾIslāmiyyah), is an umbrella organization of a number Iraqi insurgency groups established on October 15 2006. The group is composed of and supported by a variety of insurgency groups, including its predecessor, the Mujahideen Shura Council, Al-Qaeda, Jeish al-Fatiheen, Jund al-Sahaba, Katbiyan Ansar Al-Tawhid wal Sunnah, Jeish al-Taiifa al-Mansoura, etc, and other clans whose population is of Sunni faith. It aims to establish a caliphate in the Sunni dominated regions of Iraq.
It claims a presence in the governorates of Baghdad, Al Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Salah ad Din, Ninawa, and parts of Babil and Wasit, etc. It initially claimed Baqubah as its capital.
Between late 2006 and May 2007, the ISI brought the Dora neighborhood of southern Baghdad under its control. Numerous Christian families left, unwilling to pay the Jizya tax. US efforts to drive out the ISI presence stalled in late June, 2007, despite the walling-off of streets and the use of biometric identification technology. By November 2007 the ISI had been removed from Dora, and Assyrian churches could be re-opened.

In 1994, Al-Assad entered the military academy and in 1998, Al-Assad took charge of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. In December 2000, Assad married Asma Assad, née Akhras. Al-Assad was elected as President of Syria in 2000 and 2007, unopposed each time. During the Syrian uprising, activists and protesters have called for President al-Assad&#39;s resignation.
Bashar Hafez al-Assad was born in Damascus on 11 September 1965, the son of Aniseh (née Makhluf) and Hafez al-Assad. His father, Hafez al-Assad, born to a poor family of Alawite background, had risen through the Party ranks, to take control of the Syrian-led

Lockett is the highest goal scorer in the history of the VFL/AFL with 1,360 goals in a career of 281 games, that commenced in 1983 with the St Kilda Football Club, and finished in 2002 with the Sydney Swans.
