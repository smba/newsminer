The album went multi-platinum and spawned four consecutive number one singles, on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993, a series of hit records, including Emotions (1991), Music Box (1993) and Merry Christmas (1994), established her position as Columbia&amp;lsquo;s highest-selling act.

During the recording of the album Carey began to deviate from her pop background, and slowly traversed into R&amp;B and Hip-hop. After her separation from Mottola, this musical change was evident with the release of Butterfly (1997).Carey left Columbia in 2000, and signed a record-breaking $100 million recording contract with Virgin Records.

At the age of 27, he became a member of the city&amp;lsquo;s painter&amp;lsquo;s corporation, the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke, and he started to earn money as an art restorer for the city council. He worked on their large art collection that Karel van Mander had described in his book The Painting-Book (Middle Dutch: Het Schilder-Boeck), published in 1604.

In the early 1960s, Allen started performing as a stand-up comic, emphasizing monologues rather than traditional jokes. As a comic, he developed the persona of an insecure, intellectual, fretful nebbish, which he insists is quite different from his real-life personality. In 2004, Comedy Central ranked Allen in fourth place on a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics, while a UK survey ranked Allen as the third greatest comedian.By the mid-1960s Allen was writing and directing films, first specializing in slapstick comedies before moving into more dramatic material influenced by European art films during the 1970s. He is often identified as part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmakers of the mid-1960s to late &amp;lsquo;70s. Allen often stars in his own films, typically in the persona he developed as a standup.

    						Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) is an American multinational corporation which provides Internet-related products and services, including Internet search, cloud computing, software and advertising technologies. Advertising revenues from AdWords generate almost all of the company&#39;s profits.
The company was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while both attended Stanford University. Together, Brin and Page own about 16 percent of the company&#39;s stake. Google was first incorporated as a privately held company on September 4, 1998, and its initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. The company&#39;s mission statement from the outset was &quot;to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful&quot;, and the company&#39;s unofficial slogan is &quot;Don&#39;t be evil&quot;. In 2006, the company moved to its current headquarters in Mountain View, California.
Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond the company&#39;s core web search engine. The company offers online productivity software including email, an office suite, and social networking. Google&#39;s products extend to the desktop as well, with applications for web

    						Marco Polo (/ˈmɑrkoʊ ˈpoʊloʊ/; Italian pronunciation: [ˈmarko ˈpɔːlo]; c. 1254 – January 9, 1324) was a Venetian merchant traveler from the Venetian Republic whose travels are recorded in Il Milione, a book which did much to introduce Europeans to Central Asia and China. He learned about trading whilst his father and uncle, Niccolò and Maffeo, travelled through Asia and apparently met Kublai Khan. In 1269, they returned to Venice to meet Marco for the first time. The three of them embarked on an epic journey to Asia, returning after 24 years to find Venice at war with Genoa; Marco was imprisoned, and dictated his stories to a cellmate. He was released in 1299, became a wealthy merchant, married and had three children. He died in 1324, and was buried in San Lorenzo.
Their pioneering journey inspired Christopher Columbus and others. Marco Polo&#39;s other legacies include Venice Marco Polo Airport, the Marco Polo sheep, and several books and films. He also had an influence on European cartography, leading to the introduction of the Fra Mauro map.
The exact time and place of Marco Polo&#39;s birth are unknown, and current theories are mostly conjectural. One possible place of birth is

At Kim Jong-il&#39;s memorial service, North Korean Chairman of Congress Kim Yong-nam declared that &quot;Respected Comrade Kim Jong-un is our party, military and country’s supreme leader who inherits great comrade Kim Jong-il’s ideology, leadership, character, virtues, grit and courage&quot;.

    						Clement Leroy &quot;Butch&quot; Otter (born May 3, 1942) is the 32nd and current Governor of Idaho since January 2007 and is a member of the Republican Party. Otter previously represented the state&#39;s First Congressional District.
Otter was the longest serving Lieutenant Governor of Idaho, holding office from 1987–2001. He is the first Idahoan since statehood to win elections as both a United States Representative and as governor. He is the third Catholic to serve as governor of Idaho and the first to win election since James H. Hawley in 1910.
Butch Otter was born into a small family of limited means. His father was a journeyman electrician and the family lived in many rural locations in the Midwest &amp; Western U.S. during his youth, attending 15 different schools. He graduated from St. Teresa&#39;s Academy (now Bishop Kelly High School) in Boise in 1962.
Otter was 20 when he graduated from high school– a childhood accident involving gasoline badly burned his younger brother and forced Otter to take a year off. Otter worked throughout high school as a janitor, theater ticket taker, and lawn boy. &quot;My dad graduated from high school. My expectations weren’t built beyond being a good electrician or
