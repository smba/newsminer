The band&#39;s last album, Wavering Radiant, was released on May 5, 2009. They disbanded in June 2010, just before the release of a split EP with the Melvins.

As Turner states, &quot;Isis formed as a result of the dissatisfaction with past bands of the founding members. None of us were happy with what we were doing musically at the time, two of us lived together, we had similar tastes and similar record collections.&quot; Isis released a demo and their first EP, Mosquito Control, in 1998, with this line-up.
