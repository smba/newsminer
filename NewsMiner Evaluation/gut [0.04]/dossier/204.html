This party ceased to exist as an organised political entity in the early 1760s, although it was used as a term of self-description by some political writers. A few decades later, a new Tory party would rise to establish a hold on government between 1783 and 1830, with William Pitt the Younger followed by Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool.The Earl of Liverpool was succeeded by fellow Tory Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, whose term included the Catholic Emancipation, which occurred mostly due to the election of Daniel O&amp;lsquo;Connell as a Catholic MP in Ireland.

In 1890 he dispatched his son Charles to the USA on a selling trip but included in his instructions that Charles must discuss pedal engineering with Pratt and Whitney in Hartford, Connecticut and come back with a high class pedal and the machinery for making it. Charles said that the Villiers Engineering Co. was &quot;the ultimate fruit&quot; of his trip to the USA, being impressed by the production system and the labour saving devices. He pointed out that &quot;it was not possible to develop these at Sunbeamland, which had long been working on another plan, but it was possible to start them in a new factory&quot;.As a result of the tour, in 1898, John Marston bought a small Japanning works based in Villiers Street, Wolverhampton.

    						The National Party of Australia is an Australian political party.
Traditionally representing graziers, farmers and rural voters generally, it began as the Country Party, and then adopted the name the National Country Party in 1975. The party&#39;s name was changed to the National Party of Australia in 1982. The party is commonly referred to as &quot;The Nationals&quot;. Federally, in New South Wales, and to an extent Victoria, it has generally been the minor party in a centre-right Coalition with the Liberal Party of Australia in government. In Opposition it has worked in formal Coalition or separately, but generally in co-operation with the Liberal Party and it predecessors, the United Australia Party. It was the major coalition party in Queensland between 1924 and 2008, when it merged with the junior Queensland Division of the Liberal Party of Australia to form the Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP), an organisation dominated by ex-Nationals – seats listed in this article do not include the LNP.
The party&#39;s federal parliamentary leader since 3 December 2007, following the coalition&#39;s defeat at the 2007 federal election, is Warren Truss.

    						The Labour Party is a centre-left political party in the United Kingdom, and one of the two main British political parties along with the Conservative Party. The Labour Party was founded in 1900 and overtook the Liberal Party in general elections during the early 1920s, forming minority governments under Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 and 1929–1931. The party was in a wartime coalition from 1940 to 1945, after which it formed a majority government under Clement Attlee. Labour was also in government from 1964 to 1970 under Harold Wilson and from 1974 to 1979, first under Wilson and then James Callaghan.
The Labour Party was last in national government between 1997 and 2010 under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, beginning with a majority of 179, reduced to 167 in 2001 and 66 in 2005. Having won 258 seats in the 2010 general election, Labour is the Official Opposition.

He served as the Minister of Health and Minister for Communications and Information Technology for the Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand from October 2007 until November 2008. After the 2008 general election defeat of the Labour Party, and the resignation of Helen Clark as the party leader, Cunliffe was appointed to be the party&#39;s Finance Spokesman. This is considered to be the third highest ranking within the party after leader and deputy leader.

Speculation of a leadership challenge again arose during the June 2010 expenses scandal and again after the &#39;Cartergate&#39; affair.
Cunliffe studied politics at University of Otago before working first as a diplomat and then as a business consultant. In 1994 and 1995, he was a Fulbright Scholar and Kennedy Memorial Fellow at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government and
