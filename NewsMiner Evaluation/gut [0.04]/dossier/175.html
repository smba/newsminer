Inhabitants of Sydney are called Sydneysiders, comprising a cosmopolitan and international population.The site of the first British colony in Australia, Sydney was established in 1788 at Sydney Cove by Arthur Phillip, commodore of the First Fleet as a penal colony. The city is built on hills surrounding Port Jackson which is commonly known as Sydney Harbour, where the iconic Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge feature prominently. The hinterland of the metropolitan area is surrounded by national parks, and the coastal regions feature many bays, rivers, inlets and beaches including the famous Bondi Beach and Manly Beach. Within the city are many notable parks, including Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens.Sydney often ranks highly in various world cities rankings.

The genus Asio contains the eared owls, which are characterised by feather tufts on the head which have the appearance of ears. This group has representatives over most of the planet, and the Short-eared Owl is one of the most widespread of all bird species, breeding in Europe, Asia, North and South America, the Caribbean, Hawaii and the Galápagos Islands. Its geographic range extends to all continents except Antarctica and Australia.These are medium-sized owls, 30–46 cm (12–18 in) in length with 80–103 cm (31.5–40 in) wingspans. They are long winged and have the characteristic facial disc.The two northern species are partially migratory, moving south in winter from the northern parts of their range, or wandering nomadically in poor vole years in search of better food supplies. Tropical Asio owls are largely sedentary.Asio owls are mainly nocturnal, but Short-eared Owls are also crepuscular.

Less than you would think. Here’s five key questions that need to be answered from last week.<br />1. Was there a plan to behead a random member of the public in Martin Place?<br />On what is currently before the court, there is no evidence to suggest such a plot exists. In fact, if we are going from what has been provided in court, we don’t even know whether there was actually a plan to behead anyone.<br />The commonwealth prosecutor, Michael Allnutt, told the central local criminal court of the allegations against Azari: “There was a clear imperative to commit an act to shock, horrify and terrify the community as a whole.” The imminence is drawn from a very recent phone call that was intercepted, although we don’t know the precise date of this communication.<br />The suggestion that there was an attack planned in Martin Place specifically, and that it to be a public beheading, is pure conjecture from media reports. The allegation that there was a plot to behead a member of the public at a non-specific location has been given more weight because of the prime minister’s response to the following question on 18 September:<br />Journalist: “People have been asked to remain calm, but how can they when there is news that there are people willing to conduct public beheadings in <a href='175.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:16'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-25.274398,133.775136'>Australia</a>?”<br />Prime minister: “That’s the intelligence we received.

The group is composed of and supported by a variety of insurgency groups, including its predecessor, the Mujahideen Shura Council, Al-Qaeda, Jeish al-Fatiheen, Jund al-Sahaba, Katbiyan Ansar Al-Tawhid wal Sunnah, Jeish al-Taiifa al-Mansoura, etc, and other clans whose population is of Sunni faith. It aims to establish a caliphate in the Sunni dominated regions of Iraq.It claims a presence in the governorates of Baghdad, Al Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Salah ad Din, Ninawa, and parts of Babil and Wasit, etc. It initially claimed Baqubah as its capital.Between late 2006 and May 2007, the ISI brought the Dora neighborhood of southern Baghdad under its control. Numerous Christian families left, unwilling to pay the Jizya tax. US efforts to drive out the ISI presence stalled in late June, 2007, despite the walling-off of streets and the use of biometric identification technology. By November 2007 the ISI had been removed from Dora, and Assyrian churches could be re-opened.The Interior Ministry of Iraq');">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a>] to networks of support back in <a href='175.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:19'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-25.274398,133.775136'>Australia</a> to conduct demonstration killings here in this country. So, this is not just suspicion, this is intent, and that’s why the police and security agencies decided to act in the way they have.”<br />The prime minister did not, of course, sign an affidavit and tender this in court. What is key to remember is that it remains to be seen what the strength of this evidence is in court and what form it takes. A future hearing for Azari will not occur until 13 November.<br />2. How many people have been charged with terrorism offences as a result of the raids?<br />Just one. Omarjan Azari is the only person charged with a terrorism offence. One other person has been charged with an offence relating to possession of an unauthorised firearm. Two women have been issued with court attendance notices resulting from the raids, but the Australian federal police have refused to provide any details about those two notices.<br />3. Were 800 police officers really needed for an operation that saw just one person charged with a terrorism offence?<br />It’s an enormous operation for just one prosecution. The attorney general, George Brandis, suggested there was a “large body of evidence” being considered since the raids, and that whether or not further charges would be laid “is a matter about which the police and prosecutors will make a professional judgement later today or in coming days”.<br />It’s now been four days since that initial operation, and there are yet to be any further charges laid. So was this overreach? The attorney general was asked this very question last week and said:<br />“I don’t think that’s right at all, it wasn’t an overreach. This was a very complex operation because it involves accessing and disrupting networks that had a presence in <a href='175.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:22'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-33.8674869,151.2069902'>Sydney</a> and in <a href='175.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:23'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-27.4710107,153.0234489'>Brisbane</a>, and the suggestion it was overreach is nonsense, nor the fact that so far there has been one charge. That’s hardly the point. The fact is that the person who was charged had been tasked by a senior operative in <a href='175.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:24'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='43.29812,5.38257'>Université Paul Cézanne Aix-Marseille III</a>, an Australian man now resident is <a href='175.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:25'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='34.802075,38.996815'>Syria</a>, to carry out a murderous attack on random Australian citizens. So I don’t think the public would regard even disrupting that man’s murderous plan to be overreach.”<br />As Richard Ackland pointed out last week , it would certainly seem possible that Azari could have alternatively been charged with conspiracy or solicit to murder, under section 26 of the Crimes Act. It would certainly be unusual to have an 800 strong raid for one murder charge, so why is it any different for a terrorism charge?<br />4. What is a preventative detention order and why is it significant?<br />Preventative detention orders are extraordinary police powers that were created by the <a href='175.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Howard Hughes');changeContent('custom-widget-description','Howard Robard Hughes, Jr. (December 24, 1905 – April 5, 1976) was an American business magnate, investor, aviator, engineer, film producer, director, and philanthropist. He was one of the wealthiest people in the world. He gained prominence from the late 1920s as a maverick film producer, making big-budget and often controversial films like The Racket (1928), Hell&amp;lsquo;s Angels (1930), Scarface (1932), and The Outlaw (1943). Hughes was one of the most influential aviators in history; he set multiple world air-speed records, built the Hughes H-1 Racer and H-4 &quot;Hercules&quot; (better known to history as the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; aircraft), and acquired and expanded Trans World Airlines which would later on merge with American Airlines. Hughes is also remembered for his eccentric behavior and reclusive lifestyle in later life, caused in part by a worsening obsessive–compulsive disorder and chronic pain. His legacy is maintained through the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.Hughes&amp;lsquo; birthplace is recorded as either Humble or Houston, Texas. The date is also uncertain, though Hughes claimed his birthday was Christmas Eve. A 1941 affidavit birth certificate of Hughes signed by his aunt Annette Gano Lummis');">Howard Hughes</a> government and used for the first time last week. They are exceptional powers because they allow the police to apply to detain somebody without charge for up to 14 days, and in circumstances where the nature and reason of their detention is also a secret.<br />A judge can grant the order and also rule that any evidence of reasons surrounding it are to be kept secret. These orders have been the subject of intense scrutiny by legal scholars and human rights organisation s, who have voiced concern that they pose serious challenges to the rule of law in <a href='175.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:29'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-25.274398,133.775136'>Australia</a>.<br />What is perhaps most concerning about the orders is the veil of secrecy that surrounds them. The acting AFP Commissioner, Andrew Colvin, was questioned repeatedly about how many people were still being detained the day after the raids occurred on 18 September:<br />Journalist: “Prime minister, how many people are still being detained without charge and are they being held under a preventative detention order or an Asio detention?”<br />Prime minister: “I’ll get the commissioner to respond.”<br />Acting commissioner <a href='175.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Shawn Colvin');changeContent('custom-widget-description','Shawn Colvin (b.

The secrecy surrounding them raises serious concerns if people can be detained without knowledge for 14 days, without facing any criminal charges.<br />5. If detention orders can only be applied on people when there is a threat of an imminent terrorist attack, why haven’t the men who were subject to the orders been charged?<br />This is the most important question that remains unanswered. Under the <a href='175.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:33'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-31.2532183,146.921099'>New South Wales</a> laws that regulate preventative detention orders they can only be invoked in a small number of circumstances. These include when there are reasonable grounds to suspect a person will engage in a terrorist act or possess a thing connected to engage in a terrorist act or have done something in preparation of a terrorist act.<br />These are high thresholds to meet, and yet at least three of the men subject to the orders were released without charge.<br />The police have a range of other measures to hold and detain people who they suspect of committing a crime, so why were preventative detention orders the method chosen? It is also interesting to note the preventative detention and control order regime was due to lapse next year. But on Monday, just after the first use of these orders, the attorney general announced they would be not be sunsetting and would remain part of Australian law.<br />These questions and many more must be answered, and tested in court, before judgment is passed on Azari.<br />Sign up for the Guardian Today<br />Our editors' picks for the day's top news and commentary delivered to your inbox each morning.<br />
