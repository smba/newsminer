The main campus is adjacent to Beyazıt Square.The precursor of Istanbul University was the University of Constantinople, sometimes known as the University of the palace hall of Magnaura. In the Roman-Byzantine Empire it was founded in 425 under the name of Pandidakterion. The original school was founded in 425 by Emperor Theodosius II with 31 chairs for law, philosophy, medicine, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, rhetoric and other subjects, 15 to Latin and 16 to Greek. The university existed until the 15th century.After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople a madrasa, a religious school, was established. An institution of higher education named the Darülfünun-i Osmani (&amp;lsquo;House of Sciences&amp;lsquo;) was created in 1863, but suppressed in 1871. Its first rector was Hasan Tahsini, regarded as one of the most important Ottoman scholars of the 19th century. In 1874 the Imperial University (Darülfünun-i Sultani) started to give lectures in law in French, but was closed in 1881.The Imperial University, now known as Darülfünun-i Shahane was refounded in 1900, with the departments');">Istanbul University</a> and is capable of travelling 500 kilometers on only four hours’ charge.<br />After traveling through the Turkish provinces of <a href='196.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:1'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='39.92077,32.85411'>Ankara</a>, <a href='196.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:2'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='41.292782,36.33128'>Samsun</a>, <a href='196.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:3'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='41.00145,39.7177999'>Trabzon</a>, <a href='196.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:4'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='39.908611,41.276944'>Erzurum</a>, Diyarbakır and <a href='196.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:6'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='37.06622,37.38332'>Gaziantep</a>, the car was driven through the Central Anatolian province of <a href='196.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:7'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='38.73122,35.478729'>Kayseri</a>’s main thoroughfare in front of curious onlookers to go on display as part of a nationwide tour on Sept. 22.<br />The car weighs 500 kilograms and can reach speeds of up to 130 kph, said Engin Topaloğlu, one of the <a href='196.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','ITU School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering');changeContent('custom-widget-description','In 1926, the “Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering” was founded as part of the Science Faculty of Istanbul University (Istanbul Dar-ül Fünun).

    						Alberto Santos-Dumont (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈsɐ̃tuz duˈmõw̃]; (July 20, 1873 – July 23, 1932) was a Brazilian aviation pioneer. The heir of a wealthy family of coffee producers, Santos Dumont dedicated himself to science studies in Paris, France, where he spent most of his adult life.
Santos-Dumont designed, built, and flew some of the first practical dirigibles, demonstrating that routine, controlled flight was possible. This &quot;conquest of the air&quot;, in particular his winning the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize on October 19, 1901 on a flight that rounded the Eiffel Tower, made him one of the most famous people in the world during the early 20th century.
In addition to his pioneering work in airships, on 23 October 1906 Santos-Dumont, flying the 14-bis or Oiseau de proie (French for &quot;bird of prey&quot;), made the first flight of an airplane to be witnessed by the European press and certified by the Aéro Club de France and the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). Santos-Dumont is considered to be the &quot;Father of Aviation&quot; in Brazil, his native country.
Santos-Dumont occupied the 38th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, from 1931 until his death in 1932.
