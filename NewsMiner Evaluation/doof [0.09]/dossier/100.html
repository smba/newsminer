The professional associations of doctors, paramedics and nurses are urging their members not to participate in executions. According to one statement, "when the healthcare professional serves in an execution under circumstances that mimic care, the healing purposes of health services and technology become distorted." As a result, executions are carried out by doctors or nurses who are either unlicensed or acting illegally. They slip into the execution chambers like burglars, and they participate either out of conviction or for the $500 the prisons pay -- in cash, to prevent the names of those involved from being documented.<br />The prison warden asked the doctor whether he could place a second IV, to be on the safe side.

    						Christianity (from the Ancient Greek: Χριστιανός Christianos) is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus as presented in canonical gospels and other New Testament writings. It also considers the Hebrew Bible, which is known as the Old Testament, to be canonical. Adherents of the Christian faith are known as Christians.
Christians generally believe Jesus is the Son of God, God having become human and the saviour of humanity. Because of this, Christians commonly refer to Jesus as Christ or Messiah. Jesus&#39; ministry, sacrificial death, and subsequent resurrection, are often referred to as the Gospel message (&quot;good news&quot;). In short, the Gospel is news of God the Father&#39;s eternal victory over evil, and the promise of salvation and eternal life for all people, through divine grace. Jesus stated that love is the greatest commandment: &quot;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind [and] thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&quot;
Worldwide the three largest groups of Christianity are the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox churches, and the various denominations of Protestantism. The Roman

Drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers with the sixth pick of the 1975 NBA Draft out of Arizona State University, Hollins was bestowed All-Rookie first team honors that season, averaging 10.8 points in 78 games for the Blazers. Prior to his two seasons at Arizona State, he played two years at Dixie Community College in St. George, Utah.

    						Christian IV (12 April 1577 – 28 February 1648) was the king of Denmark-Norway from 1588 until his death. With a reign of more than 59 years, he is the longest-reigning monarch of Denmark, and he is frequently remembered as one of the most popular, ambitious and proactive Danish kings, having initiated many reforms and projects. He is sometimes referred to as Christian Firtal in Denmark and Christian Kvart or Quart in Norway.
The son of Frederick II, king of Denmark-Norway, and Sofie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, he was born at Frederiksborg castle in 1577. He descended, through his mother&#39;s side, from king John of Denmark, and was thus the first descendant of King John to assume the crown since the deposition of King Christian II. He succeeded to the throne at the age of 11, on the death of his father on 4 April 1588. While he was still growing up, chancellor Niels Kaas and the Rigsraadet council served as trustees of the royal power. He received a good education, and was a headstrong and talented student. At the age of 18, Christian ascended the throne on 17 August 1596.
On 30 November 1597, he married Anne Catherine of Brandenburg, a daughter of Joachim Friedrich, margrave of

    						Spiegel is one of the USA&#39;s leading direct marketing (or catalog) companies. Spiegel began as a &quot;wareroom&quot; in downtown Chicago; it is a US$3 billion, international, tri-channel, specialty retailer.
Spiegel&#39;s founder, the German-born, Forty-Eighters financier and Jewish son of a Rabbi  Joseph Spiegel, immigrated at age 8, started a home furnishings company in Chicago in April 1865, just after the end of the Civil War. Spiegel eventually became one of the most important firms in the mail-order industry, and arguably the first. In 1904, Joseph and his son, Arthur, switched to mail order. Spiegel mailed its first catalog in 1905. By 1925, it had 10 million customers. Before the Great Depression began, Spiegel (which then sold women&#39;s&#39; clothing as well as furniture) was selling over $20 million yearly through the mail. A strategy of generous consumer credit, low prices, and high volume allowed Spiegel to accomplish the remarkable feat of expanding its operations during the Great Depression.
In 1982, Spiegel was bought by Michael Otto, who took it public in 1987. In 1988, Spiegel Inc. bought Honeybee Inc., a New York women&#39;s apparel chain. Spiegel closed the 17-store retail division of
