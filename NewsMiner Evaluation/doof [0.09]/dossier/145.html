The influence on Christian thinking of the epistles ascribed to him has been significant, due in part to his association as a prominent apostle of Christianity during the spreading of the Gospel through early Christian communities across the Roman Empire.According to the writings in the New Testament, Paul was known as Saul prior to his conversion, and was dedicated to the persecution of the early disciples of Jesus in the area of Jerusalem. As Saul traveled on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus on a mission to &quot;bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem&quot;, the resurrected Jesus appeared to him in a great light.

Rent rises over 30% or 40% in concentrated areas are simply unacceptable.<br />“We are creating a fair balance between the interests of landlords and tenants. Those who invest money should in the future be able to continue earning money. But rental properties are more than just a commodity, they are the homes of people. Maximising profits cannot be the sole objective.”<br />Once the law has been passed, <a href='145.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:5'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='51.165691,10.451526'>Germany</a>’s 16 regions are to identify which specific areas will be affected by the rent-rise caps for a period of up to five years.

Until that issue is addressed, the cap will only be a short-term cure.”<br />Critics of the rent-rise cap said that it would above all benefit middle-class tenants, while those on lower incomes, who cannot afford average rents, would continue to struggle to find homes in the booming inner-city areas.<br />Sign up for the Guardian Today<br />Our editors' picks for the day's top news and commentary delivered to your inbox each morning.<br />

    						Warren Girard Ellis (born February 16, 1968) is an English author of comics, novels, and television, who is well known for sociocultural commentary, both through his online presence and through his writing, which covers transhumanist themes (most notably nanotechnology, cryonics, mind transfer, and human enhancement). He is a resident of Southend-on-Sea, England.
Ellis was born in Essex in February 1968. Ellis has stated that the televised broadcast of the moon landing is his earliest coherent memory. He was a student at the South East Essex Sixth Form College, commonly known as SEEVIC. He contributed comic work to the college magazine, Spike, along with Richard Easter, who also later followed a career in writing.
Before starting his career as a writer, Ellis did &quot;most of the shitty jobs you can imagine; ran a bookstore, ran a pub, worked in bankruptcy, worked in a record shop, lifted compost bags for a living&quot;.
Ellis&#39;s writing career started in the British independent magazine Deadline with a six-page short story published in 1990. Other early works include a Judge Dredd short and a Doctor Who one-pager. His first ongoing work, Lazarus Churchyard with D&#39;Israeli, appeared in

    						Sinn Féin (/ˌʃɪnˈfɛɪn/ shin-FAYN; Irish: [ʃɪnʲ fʲeːnʲ]) is a left wing, Irish republican political party in Ireland. The name is Irish for &quot;ourselves&quot; or &quot;we ourselves&quot;, although it is frequently mistranslated as &quot;ourselves alone&quot;. Originating in the Sinn Féin organisation founded in 1905 by Arthur Griffith, it took its current form in 1970 after a split within the party. Sinn Féin is led by Gerry Adams. Sinn Féin is the only party in Ireland which has elected representatives in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The party has historically been associated with the Provisional IRA.
Sinn Féin is currently the second-largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, where it has four ministerial posts in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive and these include the departments of OFMDFM, Culture, Arts and Leisure, Agriculture and Rural Development and Education as well as the Junior Minister post. It is the fourth largest party in Dáil Éireann, the parliament of the Republic of Ireland, where it has 14 TDs. In the 2009 European Parliamentary elections the party&#39;s candidate in Northern Ireland, Bairbre de Brún, topped the poll, the first time for Sinn Féin in any

    						Carol II (15 October 1893 – 4 April 1953) reigned as King of Romania from 8 June 1930 until 6 September 1940. Eldest son of Ferdinand, King of Romania, and his wife, Queen Marie, a daughter of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second eldest son of Queen Victoria. He was the first of the Romanian royal family who was baptized in the Orthodox rite.
Carol was born in Peleş Castle. In November 1914, Carol joined the Romanian Senate, as the 1866 Constitution guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching maturity. Known more for his romantic misadventures than for any leadership skills, Carol (Romanian for &quot;Charles&quot;) was first married in the Cathedral Church of Odessa, Ukraine, 31 August 1918, in contravention of royal law, to Joanna Marie Valentina Lambrino (1898–1953), known as &quot;Zizi&quot;, the daughter of a Romanian general. They had one son, Mircea Gregor Carol Lambrino, and the marriage was annulled by decision of the Ilfov Tribunal in 1919.
He next married, in Athens, Greece, on 10 March 1921, Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark (who was known in Romania as Crown Princess Elena. They were second cousins as both were great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria. The marriage soon collapsed in

    						Paula Hiers Deen (born January 19, 1947) is an American cook, cooking show host, restaurateur, author, actress and Emmy Award-winning television personality. Deen resides in Savannah, Georgia, where she owns and operates The Lady &amp; Sons restaurant with her sons, Jamie and Bobby Deen. She has published five cookbooks. Though married in 2004 to Michael Groover, she uses the surname Deen, from her first marriage.
Deen was born Paula Hiers in Albany, Georgia, the daughter of Corrie A. (née Paul) and Earl Wayne Hiers, Sr. Her parents died before she was 23, and an early marriage ended in divorce. In her &#39;20s, Deen suffered from panic attacks and agoraphobia. She then focused on cooking for her family as something she could do without leaving her house. In 1986, she took a job as a bank teller, and later moved to Savannah, Georgia, with her sons. In 1989, she divorced her husband, Jimmy Deen, to whom she had been married since 1965. She was left with only $200. She then started a catering service, making sandwiches and meals, which her sons Jamie and Bobby delivered. Deen&#39;s entrepreneurial efforts were not only a financial gamble, but a personal one as well. Her sons felt that the

    						Dessie Ellis (born 1953) is an Irish politician. He is a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin North–West constituency. He was a member of Dublin City Council from 1999 to 2011.
Ellis was born in Dublin in 1953 and educated there. He later worked as a television repairman. He is a former Provisional IRA prisoner; he was arrested in 1981 and charged with possession of explosives. He jumped bail but was arrested in Buffalo, New York in February 1982 and extradited to Ireland where he was sentenced to ten years&#39; imprisonment in Portlaoise Prison. On 14 November 1990, after thirty-five days on hunger-strike, Ellis became the first person extradited from the Republic of Ireland to the United Kingdom under the 1987 Extradition Act. He went on hunger-strike in protest at efforts to send him to Britain but was extradited in the sixth week of his fast.
Ellis was first elected to Dublin City Council in 1999 for the Finglas area. He unsuccessfully contested the 2002 general election in the Dublin North–West constituency, and received 4,781 first preference votes (18.3%). He was again unsuccessful at the 2007 general election in the same constituency, receiving 4,873 votes (15.7%).
