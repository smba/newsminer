					The wheel turns, the boat rocks, the sea rises<br />Change in a time of climate change<br />18 September, by Rebecca Solnit<br />There have undoubtedly been stable periods in human history, but you and your parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents never lived through one, and neither will any children or grandchildren you may have or come to have. Everything has been changing continuously, profoundly — from the role of women to the nature of agriculture. For the past couple of hundred years, change has been accelerating in both magnificent and nightmarish ways.<br />Yet when we argue for change, notably changing our ways in response to climate change, we’re arguing against people who claim we’re disrupting a stable system. They insist that we’re rocking the boat unnecessarily.<br />I say: rock that boat. It’s a lifeboat; maybe the people in it will wake up and start rowing. Those who think they’re hanging onto a stable order are actually clinging to the wreckage of the old order, a ship already sinking, that we need to leave behind.<br />As you probably know, the actual oceans are rising — almost eight inches since 1880, and that’s only going to accelerate. They’re also acidifying , because they’re absorbing significant amounts of the carbon we continue to pump into the atmosphere at record levels. The ice that covers the polar seas is shrinking, while the ice shields that cover <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:1'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-82.8627519,-135.0'>Antarctica</a> and <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:2'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='71.706936,-42.604303'>Greenland</a> are melting. The water locked up in all the polar ice, as it’s unlocked by heat, is going to raise sea level s staggeringly, possibly by as much as 200 feet at some point in the future, how distant we do not know. In the temperate latitudes, warming seas breed fiercer hurricanes.<br />The oceans are changing fast, and for the worse. Fish stocks are dying off, as are shellfish. In many acidified oceanic regions, their shells are actually dissolving or failing to form, which is one of the scariest, most nightmarish things I’ve ever heard. So don’t tell me that we’re rocking a stable boat on calm seas. The glorious 10,000-year period of stable climate in which humanity flourished and then exploded to overrun the <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:3'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='34.2331373,-102.4107493'>Earth</a> and all its ecosystems is over.<br />But responding to these current cataclysmic changes means taking on people who believe, or at least assert, that those of us who want to react and act are gratuitously disrupting a stable system that’s working fine. It isn’t stable. It is working fine — in the short term and the most limited sense — for oil companies and the people who profit from them and for some of us in the particularly cushy parts of the world who haven’t been impacted yet by weather events like, say, the recent torrential floods in <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:4'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='36.204824,138.252924'>Japan</a> or southern <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:5'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='38.8026097,-116.419389'>Nevada</a> and <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:6'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='34.0489281,-111.0937311'>Arizona</a>, or the monsoon versions of the same that have devastated parts of <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:7'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='20.593684,78.96288'>India</a> and <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:8'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='30.375321,69.345116'>Pakistan</a>, or the drought that has mummified my beloved <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:9'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='36.778261,-119.4179324'>California</a>, or the wildfires of <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:10'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-25.274398,133.775136'>Australia</a>.<br />The problem, of course, is that the people who most benefit from the current arrangements have effectively purchased a lot of politicians, and that a great many of the rest of them are either hopelessly dim or amazingly timid.

More than 1,000 groups are coordinating the march — environmental justice groups, faith groups, labor groups — which means there’s no one policy ask. Instead, it’s designed to serve as a loud and pointed reminder to our leaders, gathering that week at the <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','United Nations');changeContent('custom-widget-description','The United Nations (abbreviated UN in English, and ONU in its other official languages), is an international organization whose stated aims are facilitating cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights, and achievement of world peace.

We march because Hurricane Sandy filled the <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:6'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='40.7127837,-74.0059413'>New York City</a> subway system with salt water, reminding us that even one of the most powerful cities in the world is already vulnerable to slowly rising ocean levels.<br />We march because we know that climate change affects everyone, but its impacts are not equally felt: those who have contributed the least to causing the crisis are hit hardest, here and around the world. Communities on the frontlines of global warming are already paying a heavy price, in some cases losing the very land on which they live. This isn’t just about polar bears any more.<br />But since polar bears can’t march, we march for them, too, and for the rest of creation now poised on the verge of what biologists say will be the planet’s sixth great extinction event, one unequalled since the last time a huge asteroid struck the Earth 66 million years ago.<br />And we march for generations yet to come, our children, grandchildren, and their children, whose lives will be systematically impoverished and degraded. It’s the first time one century has wrecked the prospects of the millennia to come, and it makes us mad enough to march.<br />We march with hope, too. We see a few great examples around the world of how quickly we could make the transition to renewable energy. We know that if there were days this summer when <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:7'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='51.165691,10.451526'>Germany</a> generated nearly 75% of its power from renewable sources of energy, the rest of us could, too — especially in poorer nations around the equator that desperately need more energy. And we know that labor-intensive renewables would provide far more jobs than capital-intensive coal, gas, and oil.<br />And we march with some frustration: why haven’t our societies responded to 25 years of dire warnings from scientists? We’re not naïve; we know that the fossil fuel industry is the 1% of the 1%. But sometimes we think we shouldn’t have to march. If our system worked the way it should, the world would long ago have taken the obvious actions economists and policy gurus have recommended — from taxing carbon to reflect the damage it causes to funding a massive World War II-scale transition to clean energy.<br />Marching is not all, or even most, of what we do. We advocate; we work to install solar panels; we push for sustainable transit. We know, though, that history shows marching is usually required, that reason rarely prevails on its own. (And we know that sometimes even marching isn’t enough; we’ve been to jail and we’ll likely be back.)<br />We’re tired of winning the argument and losing the fight. And so we march. We march for the beaches and the barrios. We march for summers when the cool breeze still comes down in the evening. We march because <a href='118.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Exxon Mobil');changeContent('custom-widget-description','Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) or ExxonMobil, is an American multinational oil and gas corporation.

It is affiliated with Imperial Oil which operates in Canada.ExxonMobil is one of the largest publicly traded companies by market capitalization in the world and is the largest company in the world by revenue.

With 37 oil refineries in 21 countries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 6.3 million barrels (1,000,000 m), Exxon Mobil is the largest refiner in the world, a title that was also associated with Standard Oil since its incorporation in 1870.ExxonMobil is the largest of the six oil supermajors with daily production of 3.921 million BOE (barrels of oil equivalent).

If you were a betting person, perhaps you’d say we have only modest hope of beating the financial might of the oil and gas barons and the governments in their thrall. It’s obviously too late to stop global warming entirely, but not too late to slow it down — and it’s not too late, either, to simply pay witness to what we’re losing, a world of great beauty and complexity and stability that has nurtured humanity for thousands of years.<br />There’s a world to march for — and a future, too. The only real question is why anyone wouldn’t march.<br />This article was first published in Tom Dispatch , 14 September 2014.<br />Latest articles<br />

He would hold this office until November 2008, when he resigned following his victory in the 2008 presidential election.
Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he was the president of the Harvard Law Review. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney in Chicago and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004.
Following an unsuccessful bid against the Democratic incumbent for a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 2000, Obama ran for the United States Senate in 2004.

    						The European Union (EU) /ˌjʊrəˈpiːənˈjuːnjən/ is an economic and political union or confederation of 27 member states which are located primarily in Europe. The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), formed by six countries in 1958. In the intervening years the EU has grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union under its current name in 1993. The latest amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.
The EU operates through a system of supranational independent institutions and intergovernmental negotiated decisions by the member states. Important institutions of the EU include the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, the European Council, the Court of Justice of the European Union, and the European Central Bank. The European Parliament is elected every five years by EU citizens.

    						The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA/GA) is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations and the only one in which all member nations have equal representation. Its powers are to oversee the budget of the United Nations, appoint the non-permanent members to the Security Council, receive reports from other parts of the United Nations and make recommendations in the form of General Assembly Resolutions. It has also established a wide number of subsidiary organs.
The General Assembly meets under its president or Secretary-General in regular yearly sessions the main part of which lasts from September to December and resumed part from January until all issues are addressed (which often is just before the next session&#39;s start). It can also reconvene for special and emergency special sessions. Its composition, functions, powers, voting, and procedures are set out in Chapter IV of the United Nations Charter.
The first session was convened on 10 January 1946 in the Westminster Central Hall in London and included representatives of 51 nations.
