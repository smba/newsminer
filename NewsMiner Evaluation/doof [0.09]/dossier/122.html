    						Saint Abramios the Recluse (290–360) was an early Christian hermit and ascetic from Edessa.
Abramios was born in 290 AD in Edessa (modern-day Şanlıurfa, Turkey). On the day of his wedding, he left his fiancée and went to the coast of the Sea of Marmara, near Lampsacus (modern-day Lapseki). There, he lived in a cave and left it only two times: first, when he was ordered to baptise a pagan village; and second, to free his niece Maria from sin. He died in 360 AD.
