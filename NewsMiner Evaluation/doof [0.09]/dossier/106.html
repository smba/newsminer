The modern Irish state was established in 1922 as the Irish Free State, a dominion within the British Empire, following the Anglo-Irish Treaty which brought an end to the Irish War of Independence. The partition of Ireland had already been provided for in previous British legislation in 1921 in response to opposition to Irish Home Rule or independence by Unionists, who formed a majority in the north-eastern part of the country. Six of the nine counties in the northern province of Ulster were established under that legislation as Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, with which the Irish state shares its only land border. The state is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, St George&amp;lsquo;s Channel to the south east, and the Irish Sea to the east.In 1801, the kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain, previously in a personal union, were united to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

Councillors would, of course, like to reduce the burden on their constituents, but don’t have their same cash to play about with.<br />For example, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown has just over 80,000 taxable homes and to the middle of this year had collected almost €39 million in property tax.
