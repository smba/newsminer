					People rally to save Lake Burdur from drought ahead of ‘water fast’<br />Support is pouring in to save Lake Burdur from disappearing ahead of a weekend gathering that will include events to draw attention to the environmental problems of the area in what is being billed as a “water fast.”<br />Artists, politicians, scholars, activists, students and local farmers and villagers have sent videos to urge authorities to find a solution to a fast-paced drought that, according to experts, may lead to the extinction of the lake in a mere 20 years.

Activists have also called for a better use of the waters in the area, especially for farming and livestock breeding.<br />The lake is also home to many birds species and to a small endemic fish called “burduricus.” Social media users will be able to show their support for the events with the hashtags #SuOrucu (water fast) and #GöleYas (mourning for the lake).<br />September/23/2014<br />

					Desi Anwar: Caving and Tubing<br />By Desi Anwar on 08:08 pm Sep 23, 2014<br />Tags: Tourism , Writer's Block , yogyakarta<br />Next time you want to get away from it all and enjoy nature that is not your usual beach or mountain, try caving in <a href='137.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:2'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-6.2990454,107.3597804'>Gunung Kidul Regency</a> district in the southeastern part of the <a href='137.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:3'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-7.7970684,110.3705267'>Yogyakarta</a> province. The area is known for its dryness and difficulty in getting water for irrigation as it is in a karst region. However, the karst also gives the area its unique characteristics, with many caves and underground rivers with pristine clear waters.<br />I decide to visit some of these caves. The first is the Pindul Cave, Gua Pindul, which is around an hour-and-a-halve drive from <a href='137.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:4'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-7.7970684,110.3705267'>Yogyakarta</a> city, which, since a few years ago, you can explore while floating on rubber body rafts made from the inner tubes of a large tire, in an activity called tubing.<br />Before this ingenious tourism activity, the caves in this area were practically inaccessible. Now, tubing is one of the most popular activities especially for school children and local tourists as, I shall soon find out, it’s extremely fun and safe.<br />My driver and local guide Aris takes me to a tour operator where, after paying around $3, we’re kitted out in life jackets (a must) and given our black rubber lifesaver. A few meters further, we are at the edge of the underground river that leads to the mouth of Pindul Cave.<br />The cave itself is around 350 meters long, with a water depth that varies from five meters to 12 meters, and a ceiling of around four meters. It was home to swallows and bats, though nowadays the constant stream of visitors have forced them to seek a new home elsewhere, though it is easy to see the traces of bat urine decorating the cave ceiling.<br />We wade in the river, sit back on our raft and begin our 45-minute journey into the underground darkness, our bottoms immediately wet. Reaching the inside of the cave, the light dims and I promptly lose my sunglasses, which sink to the bottom of the six-meter deep water.<br />The cave has three zones, each with increasing darkness. The last part is called the Eternal Darkness zone, because it is, well, really dark. As we float on the river towards the exit of the cave, the place lit only by our guides’ torches, one can really appreciate the beauty of this ancient grotto with pick marked walls and enormous stalactites hanging down from the ceiling, as well as stalagmites, reaching up from the bottom of the river, as if in some enormous and dark cathedral.<br />This cave tubing experience is often continued with a trip down the river Oyo, or Kali Oyo, a few minutes’ drive away in the back of a pick-up truck. As I’m already wet, I decide to be a sport and pay an extra $4 for the next adventure.<br />The road to the river is bumpy but scenic, passing through hectares of cajuput plantation. I roll some leaves against my fingers and the familiar aroma of cajuput oil used in ointments to cure all sorts of Indonesians’ ailments, especially masuk angin, or catching wind, wafts to my nose.<br />It is still the dry season and the river is not too deep nor the current too rapid, making the water a clear, emerald green hue the likes of which one would never see in <a href='137.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:5'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-6.2087634,106.845599'>Jakarta</a>.
