He was appointed Acting Supreme Patriarch in 2005 due to the failing health of the incumbent Supreme Patriarch Nyanasamvara Suvaddhana. He is a monk of the Mahanikaya order, and is of Thai Chinese descent. His appointment provoked severe criticism from Luang Ta Maha Bua (of the Dhammayuttika Nikaya order) and Sondhi Limthongkul, who claimed that the appointment created two Supreme Patriarchs and contravened the royal prerogative of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. In 4 March 2005, Maha Bua even petitioned King Bhumibol Adulyadej to remove all of Kiaw&amp;lsquo;s royal titles.');">Somdet Kiaw</a> is the touristy one, Koh Pha Ngan the party one, and Koh Tao – which means turtle island – the chilled-out one. Or so the travel websites will tell you.<br />Koh Tao is a hangout for scuba divers. Dive-centres-cum-hotels line the shores, ferrying groups of tourists out to dive or snorkel the warm, beautiful blue waters. It is a world of dreadlocks, fruit smoothies and $2 gin-and-tonics as the sun sets.<br />‘There is a laissez-faire approach to planning law; some hotels and bars seem cobbled together from driftwood’. Photograph: Cathy Alexander<br />Alex Garland’s novel The Beach was set in this part of the world and the hedonistic full-moon parties on neighbouring Koh Pha Ngan are an international event.<br />Koh Tao has less of a hard-partying feel. Bars do line the main beach of Sai Ree, where the British backpackers died, and there are plenty of under-30s on the island (mainly Europeans and Brits). But those looking to cut loose head to Koh Pha Ngan.<br />The few roads the island has are poor, so it is quite hard to get around its 21 sq km. Isolated settlements and resorts pock the coastline. We took a water taxi to our hotel. The road was hard work; coconut shells had been used to fill potholes.<br />‘Koh Tao is a world of dreadlocks, fruit smoothies and $2 gin-and-tonics’.

There were protests against the coup and a curfew, but this has been lifted and the situation seems stable. There will now be fresh concerns for tourism operators that if foreign visitors fear attacks they will stop coming to the island or <a href='135.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:10'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='15.870032,100.992541'>Thailand</a> itself.<br />“This should not have happened in <a href='135.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:11'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='15.870032,100.992541'>Thailand</a>. It will affect our image in the eyes of international countries,” the prime minister, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, has said.<br />One factor that may affect the investigation into the deaths of the British backpackers is that Koh Tao island is not easy to get away from. It has no airport and just one port. Ferry trips, which are professionally run, often involve multiple legs and take hours. So anyone who left Koh Tao after the murders may well have been noticed by other passengers, ferry staff or taxi drivers.<br />Sign up for the Guardian Today<br />Our editors' picks for the day's top news and commentary delivered to your inbox each morning.<br />

    						Ernesto Sabato (June 24, 1911 – April 30, 2011) was an Argentine writer, painter and physicist. According to the BBC he &quot;won some of the most prestigious prizes in Hispanic literature&quot; and &quot;became very influential in the literary world throughout Latin America&quot;. Upon his death El País dubbed him the &quot;last classic writer in Argentine literature&quot;.
Sabato was distinguished by his bald pate and brush moustache and wore tinted spectacles and open-necked shirts. He was born in Rojas, a small town in Buenos Aires Province. Sabato began his studies at the Colegio Nacional de La Plata. He then studied physics at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata, where he earned a Ph.D. He then attended the Sorbonne in Paris and worked at the Curie Institute. After World War II, he lost faith in science and started writing.
Sabato&#39;s oeuvre includes three novels: El Túnel (1948), Sobre héroes y tumbas (1961) and Abaddón el exterminador (1974). The first of these received critical acclaim upon its publication from, among others, fellow writers Albert Camus and Thomas Mann. The second is regarded as his masterpiece, though he nearly burnt it like many of his other works. Sabato&#39;s essays cover topics as
