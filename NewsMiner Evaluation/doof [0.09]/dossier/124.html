					Education with a debt sentence<br />For-profit colleges as American dream drushers and factories of debt<br />22 September, by Hannah Appel and  Astra Taylor<br />Imagine corporations that intentionally target low-income single mothers as ideal customers. Imagine that these same companies claim to sell tickets to the American dream — gainful employment, the chance for a middle class life. Imagine that the fine print on these tickets, once purchased, reveals them to be little more than debt contracts, profitable to the corporation’s investors, but disastrous for its customers. And imagine that these corporations receive tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to do this dirty work. Now, know that these corporations actually exist and are universities.<br />Over the last three decades, the price of a year of college has increased by more than 1,200% . In the past, American higher education has always been associated with upward mobility, but with student loan debt quadrupling between 2003 and 2013, it’s time to ask whether education alone can really move people up the class ladder.

All three are concerned with generating revenue, but only the for-profit model exists primarily to enrich its owners. The largest of these institutions are often publicly traded, nationally franchised corporations legally beholden to maximize profit for their shareholders before maximizing education for their students. While commercial vocational programs have existed since the nineteenth century, for-profit colleges in their current form are a relatively new phenomenon that began to boom with a series of initial public offerings in the 1990s, followed quickly by deregulation of the sector as the millennium approached. <a href='124.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','George W.

The fact is that for-profits like Corinthian exemplify all the contradictions of the free-market model that reformers present as the only solution to the current crisis in higher education: not only are these schools 90% dependent on taxpayer money, but tenure doesn’t exist, there are no faculty unions, most courses are offered online with low overhead costs, and students are treated as “customers.”<br />It’s also worth remembering that at “public” universities, it is now nearly impossible for working class or even middle class students to graduate without debt. This sad state of affairs — so the common version of the story goes — is the consequence of economic hard-times, which require belt tightening and budget cuts. And so it has come to pass that strapped community colleges are now turning away would-be enrollees who wind up in the embrace of for-profits that proceed to squeeze every penny they can from them and the public purse as well. (All the while, of course, this same tale provides for-profits with a cover: they are offering a public service to a marginalized and needy population no one else will touch.)<br />The standard narrative that, in the face of shrinking tax revenues, public universities must relentlessly raise tuition rates turns out, however, to be full of holes. As political theorist Robert Meister points out, this version of the story ignores the complicity of university leaders in the process. Many of them were never passive victims of privatization; instead, they saw tuition, not taxpayer funding, as the superior and preferred form of revenue growth.<br />Beginning in the 1990s, universities, public and private, began working ever more closely with Wall Street, which meant using tuition payments not just as direct revenue but also as collateral for debt-financing.

A medical bill that was originally $1,000 might sell to a debt collector for 4% of its sticker price, or $40. This allowed the Rolling Jubilee project to make a multi-million dollar impact with a budget of approximately $700,000 raised in large part through small individual donations.<br />The point of the Rolling Jubilee is simple enough: we believe people shouldn’t have to go into debt for basic needs. For the last four decades, easy access to credit has masked stagnating wages and crumbling social services, forcing many Americans to debt-finance necessities like college, health care, and housing, while the creditor class has reaped enormous rewards. But while we mean the Jubilee’s acts to be significant, we know it is not a sustainable solution to the problem at hand. There is no way to buy and abolish all the odious debt sloshing around our economy, nor would we want to. Given the way our economy is structured, people would start slipping into the red again the minute their debts were wiped out.<br />The Rolling Jubilee instead raises a question: If a ragtag group of activists can find a way to provide immediate relief to even a few thousand defrauded students, why can’t the government?<br />The <a href='124.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Consumer Financial Protection Bureau');changeContent('custom-widget-description','The United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is the federal agency that holds primary responsibility for regulating consumer protection in the United States.

There are two popular images of this scenario seared into our collective imagination: the Frankenstein monster coming to life with a jolt of electricity and, more recently, <a href='124.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Jack Nicholson');changeContent('custom-widget-description','John Joseph &quot;Jack&quot; Nicholson (born April 22, 1937) is an American actor, film director, producer, and writer. He is renowned for his often dark portrayals of neurotic characters. His twelve Oscar nominations make him the second most nominated actor of all time, behind only Meryl Streep, and tied with Katharine Hepburn.Nicholson has been nominated for an Academy Award twelve times and has won the Academy Award for Best Actor twice: for One Flew Over the Cuckoo&amp;lsquo;s Nest and for As Good as It Gets. He also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the 1983 film Terms of Endearment. He is tied with Walter Brennan for most acting wins by a male actor (three). Nicholson is well known for playing villainous roles such as Jack Torrance in The Shining, Frank Costello in The Departed, and the Joker in 1989&amp;lsquo;s Batman, among many other roles.Nicholson is one of only two actors who have been nominated for an Academy Award for acting in every decade from the 1960s to 2000s; the other is Michael Caine. He has won seven Golden Globe Awards, and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. In 1994, he became one of the youngest actors to be awarded the American Film Institute&amp;lsquo;s Life');">Jack Nicholson</a> in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest who is forced into electroshock therapy. Let’s just say he lost his joie de vivre.<br />That’s why when I told people, "I’m working on a story about a form of therapy that involves placing electrodes on the head," I got a range of reactions — from looks of disbelief to downright aghast faces.<br />The therapy is called transcranial direct current stimulation or TDCS and it actually only involves about 1/400th of the amount of current applied in electroshock therapy. The amount is so small that some people don’t discern anything while others have described a slight tingling, itching or burning. In other words, no convulsing, foaming at the mouth or involuntary twitching of the body.<br />There is a lot of buzz about it lately in neuroscience circles with a growing number of studies using TDCS to treat a range of illnesses from schizophrenia, depression, to forms of brain damage caused by strokes.<br />TDCS works by placing a positive electrode and a negative electrode to specific parts of the brain. When the TDCS device is turned on, the current makes its way through the scalp, affecting the brain region beneath. The current is too small to actually make the neurons fire but, depending on the type of stimulation, it’s just enough to either enhance or diminish their natural ability to fire.<br />The therapeutic applications of TDCS are currently being tested in clinical trials around the world. Some of the most promising studies involve depression, including one in <a href='124.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:1'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-14.235004,-51.92528'>Brazil</a> , which is comparing the effects of Zoloft against TDCS. Researchers hope that TDCS as an “electroceutical” might be an alternative to pharmaceuticals which often have side effects. Or TDCS might be simply used on patients whose depression can’t be treated by medications.<br />But it’s not just those with serious mood disorders or mental illnesses who might benefit from TDCS. (Here’s the part in the conversation in which those who pooh-pooh the idea of zapping the brain usually sit up and take notice.) There are studies looking at how TDCS could help you lose weight . Yup, apparently if you dial up the neuronal activity in the brain associated with rational decision making, you might not reach for that bag of potato chips.

The military apparently would like sleep-deprived soldiers to maintain their vigilance without trigger-happy jitters. That’s why they’ve funded studies which compare the effects of TDCS versus caffeine . Apparently, TDCS did a better job.<br />There could even be a way to use TDCS to foster creativity .

Incorporated as The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities.Benjamin Franklin, Penn&amp;lsquo;s founder, advocated an educational program that focused as much on practical education for commerce and public service as on the classics and theology. Penn was one of the first academic institutions to follow a multidisciplinary model pioneered by several European universities, concentrating multiple &quot;faculties&quot; (e.g., theology, classics, medicine) into one institution. It was also home to many other educational innovations.

    						The United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is the federal agency that holds primary responsibility for regulating consumer protection in the United States. The bureau began operation on July 21, 2011. It was founded as a result of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which passed during the 111th United States Congress in response to the Late-2000s recession and financial crisis. The bureau was set up by Elizabeth Warren, who was passed over for director  in favor of Richard Cordray. Cordray&#39;s confirmation was delayed by Republicans in the United States Senate. On January 4, 2012, Barack Obama issued a recess appointment to install Cordray as director through the end of 2013. The bureau has become the &quot;focus of bitter fighting between the Obama administration on one side and Republicans and banking lobbyists on the other&quot;.
The CFPB opened its website in early February 2011 to accept suggestions from consumers via YouTube, Twitter and its own website interface. According to the United States Treasury Department, the bureau is tasked with the responsibility to &quot;promote fairness and transparency for mortgages, credit cards, and other

    						Nathan the Prophet (Hebrew: נתן הנביא‎; fl. c. 1000 BC) was a court prophet who lived in the time of King David and Queen Bathsheba. He came to David to reprimand him over his committing adultery with Bathsheba while she was the wife of Uriah the Hittite whose death the King had also arranged to hide his previous transgression.
His actions are described in the Books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles (see especially, 2 Samuel 7:2-17, 12:1-25.) Nathan wrote histories of the reigns of both David and of Solomon (see 1 Chronicles 29:29 and 2 Chronicles 9:29), and was involved in the music of the temple (see 2 Chronicles 29:25).
In 1 Kings 1:8-45 it is Nathan who tells the dying David of the plot of Adonijah to become king, resulting in Solomon being proclaimed king instead.
The feast day of Nathan the Prophet is on 24 October. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, he is commemorated as a saint on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (i.e., the Sunday before the Great Feast of the Nativity of the Lord).
King David named one of his sons after the prophet. The third of four sons born to David and Bathsheba

    						Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus (October 28, 1466? – July 12, 1536), known as Erasmus of Rotterdam, was a Dutch Renaissance humanist, Catholic priest, social critic, teacher, and theologian.
Erasmus was a classical scholar who wrote in a pure Latin style. He was an early proponent of religious toleration, and enjoyed the sobriquet &quot;Prince of the Humanists&quot;; he has been called &quot;the crowning glory of the Christian humanists.&quot; Using humanist techniques for working on texts, he prepared important new Latin and Greek editions of the New Testament. These raised questions that would be influential in the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation. He also wrote The Praise of Folly, Handbook of a Christian Knight, On Civility in Children, Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style, Julius Exclusus, and many other works.
Erasmus lived through the Reformation period, but while he was critical of the Church, he did not join the cause of the Reformers. In relation to clerical abuses in the Church, Erasmus remained committed to reforming the Church from within. He also held to Catholic doctrines such as that of free will, which some Reformers rejected in favor of the doctrine of

    						The European Union (EU) /ˌjʊrəˈpiːənˈjuːnjən/ is an economic and political union or confederation of 27 member states which are located primarily in Europe. The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), formed by six countries in 1958. In the intervening years the EU has grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union under its current name in 1993. The latest amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.
The EU operates through a system of supranational independent institutions and intergovernmental negotiated decisions by the member states. Important institutions of the EU include the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, the European Council, the Court of Justice of the European Union, and the European Central Bank. The European Parliament is elected every five years by EU citizens.
