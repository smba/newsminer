Spiegel eventually became one of the most important firms in the mail-order industry, and arguably the first. In 1904, Joseph and his son, Arthur, switched to mail order. Spiegel mailed its first catalog in 1905. By 1925, it had 10 million customers. Before the Great Depression began, Spiegel (which then sold women&amp;lsquo;s&amp;lsquo; clothing as well as furniture) was selling over $20 million yearly through the mail. A strategy of generous consumer credit, low prices, and high volume allowed Spiegel to accomplish the remarkable feat of expanding its operations during the Great Depression.In 1982, Spiegel was bought by Michael Otto, who took it public in 1987. In 1988, Spiegel Inc. bought Honeybee Inc., a New York women&amp;lsquo;s apparel chain.

Under Morsi, Islamists had a free rein in parliament and in the media to make reactionary statements.

Samer says he and his colleagues feared their fellow Egyptians as much as the state during the Morsi presidency, and expected to be attacked by civilians egged on by reactionary discourse prevalent in the media. Now he's not so worried. "Under the Brotherhood, the aggressive speech was very loud, and it pushed people in a certain direction," says Samer. "Because of that, people who refused this kind of speech were accused of being infidels. But now that rhetoric has a quieter tune."<br />A project such as Neamat Saty's – which aims to tackle both jihadist and atheist thought – exemplifies the state's approach: a silencing of extremist rhetoric that nevertheless goes hand in hand with the use of religion to solidify government control. "It's not interfering in people's lives," she said. "It's correcting wrong concepts.

In 2010, Forbes selected him 26th in the list of &amp;lsquo;World&amp;lsquo;s Most Powerful People&amp;lsquo;.Holding absolute power in his country, he has been described as one of only three people having &quot;important influence&quot; during the history of the Islamic Republic of Iran . Khamenei was the victim of an attempted assassination in June 1981 that paralyzed his right arm, although so far the biggest challenge to his leadership has been the mass protests following the June 2009 presidential elections during which he strongly supported president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. They have had a falling out since.Khamenei holds the title of Sayyed, which means that he claims direct patrilineal descent from Ali ibn Abi Talib. Some of Khamenei&amp;lsquo;s ancestors are from Tafresh in today&amp;lsquo;s Markazi province, and had migrated from their original home in Tafresh to Tabriz. Born in Mashhad, he is second eldest of eight children, and two of his');">Ali Khamenei</a>, and the constraints laid down by him has shown how tied Rouhani’s hands are, showing more than ever who is in charge of <a href='132.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:56'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='32.427908,53.688046'>Iran</a>’s foreign policy.<br />Despite this, Rouhani faces huge domestic challenges. The worry is that the president has shown little desire, at least in public, to tackle the challenges posed by Iranian hardliners, but unless he is prepared to get to grips with them, he risks being seen as a weak leader whose very legitimacy is in question.<br />Sign up for the Guardian Today<br />Our editors' picks for the day's top news and commentary delivered to your inbox each morning.<br />

    						The Islamic State of Iraq (ISI, Arabic: دولة العراق الإسلامية‎ Dawlat al-ʿIrāq al-ʾIslāmiyyah), is an umbrella organization of a number Iraqi insurgency groups established on October 15 2006. The group is composed of and supported by a variety of insurgency groups, including its predecessor, the Mujahideen Shura Council, Al-Qaeda, Jeish al-Fatiheen, Jund al-Sahaba, Katbiyan Ansar Al-Tawhid wal Sunnah, Jeish al-Taiifa al-Mansoura, etc, and other clans whose population is of Sunni faith. It aims to establish a caliphate in the Sunni dominated regions of Iraq.
It claims a presence in the governorates of Baghdad, Al Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Salah ad Din, Ninawa, and parts of Babil and Wasit, etc. It initially claimed Baqubah as its capital.
Between late 2006 and May 2007, the ISI brought the Dora neighborhood of southern Baghdad under its control. Numerous Christian families left, unwilling to pay the Jizya tax. US efforts to drive out the ISI presence stalled in late June, 2007, despite the walling-off of streets and the use of biometric identification technology. By November 2007 the ISI had been removed from Dora, and Assyrian churches could be re-opened.
