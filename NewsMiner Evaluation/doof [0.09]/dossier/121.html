In the United States, United Kingdom, and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a &quot;colliery&quot;. In Australia, &quot;colliery&quot; generally refers to an underground coal mine.Coal mining has had a lot of developments over the recent years, from the early days of men tunneling, digging and manually extracting the coal on carts to large open cut and long wall mines. Mining at this scale requires the use of draglines, trucks, conveyor, jacks and shearers.Coal mining can have a large environmental impact and needs to be managed. Many mines are required by government to rehabilitate the area that was mined.The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the 18th century, and later spread to continental Europe and North America, was based on the availability of coal to power steam engines.

Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them.

The visual elements of cinema give motion pictures a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles that translate the dialogue into the language of the viewer.
Films are made up of a series of individual images called frames. When these images are shown rapidly in succession, a viewer has the illusion that motion is occurring. The viewer cannot see the flickering between frames due to an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. Viewers perceive motion due to a
