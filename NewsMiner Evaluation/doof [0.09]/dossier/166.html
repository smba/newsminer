    						Wilhelm Richard Wagner ( /ˈvɑːɡnər/; German pronunciation: [ˈʁiçaʁt ˈvaːɡnɐ]; 22 May 1813 – 13 February 1883) was a German composer, conductor, theatre director and polemicist primarily known for his operas (or &quot;music dramas&quot;, as he later called them). Wagner&#39;s compositions, particularly those of his later period, are notable for their complex texture, rich harmonies and orchestration, and the elaborate use of leitmotifs: musical themes associated with individual characters, places, ideas or plot elements. Unlike most other opera composers, Wagner wrote both the music and libretto for every one of his stage works. Perhaps the two best-known extracts from his works are the Ride of the Valkyries from the opera Die Walküre, and the Wedding March (Bridal Chorus) from the opera Lohengrin.
Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works such as The Flying Dutchman and Tannhäuser which were broadly in the romantic vein of Weber and Meyerbeer, Wagner transformed operatic thought through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk (&quot;total work of art&quot;). This would achieve the synthesis of all the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts and was announced in a series of essays between

    						Jorge Milton Capitanich (born November 28, 1964) is an Argentine Justicialist Party politician from Chaco Province, currently the governor of that province. He formerly represented the Chaco Province in the Argentine Senate from 10 October 2001 to 12 September 2007.
Capitanich (originally probably Kapitanić) descends from the first Montenegrins who settled in Chaco and created Colonia La Montenegrina, the biggest Montenegrin colony in South America. He was born in Presidencia Roque Sáenz Peña, and enrolled at the National University of the Northeast, graduating with a degree in accountancy in 1988. He earned a post-graduate degree in Public Administration from the University of Belgrano in 1991, and taught in his discipline. He later earned a master&#39;s degree at the ESEADE business school, and at the University of San Andrés.
Capitanich was elected Senator for Chaco in October 2001, and named interim Minister of Economy of Argentina during the institutional crisis of December 21 of that year, serving for two days in the post. President Eduardo Duhalde appointed Capitanich Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers in January 2002, serving until May. He retained his Senate seat, and supported
