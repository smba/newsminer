I found myself in the cafeteria on a recent afternoon indulging myself as a way to bridge the gap between lunch and dinner: A small piece of pleasure for the affordable price of 1.20.<br />But who really needs red wine to live? Or a VW Golf? Or strawberry cake? Nobody. They are certainly not necessary for survival. But that is what we have decided to spend our money on -- instead of sending it to places where people are dying because they don't have enough. Places where people have no future, leading them to flee. It is our red wine, Golfs and cakes against their lives.<br />That is <a href='160.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:11'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='54.5259614,15.2551187'>Europe</a>'s original sin, one into which pretty much everyone on the Continent is born, whether we like it or not. The gray area begins with the first bottle of red wine that nobody needs. It marks the loss of innocence, no matter what kind of asylum policies one supports: strict or loose, with or without razor wire. It marks the moment when we begin talking about prosperity rather than survival, and about how much of that prosperity we are willing to sacrifice. It is not, of course, a discussion as to whether we are prepared to give up our prosperity altogether.<br />Striving for happiness is programmed into humanity's DNA. Searching for that happiness in material consumption is the path chosen by the overwhelming majority of Europeans. It is also the path subscribed to by the majority of refugees seeking to make a new start in the <a href='160.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:12'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='40.7496988,-73.9737561'>European Union</a>. Most of them aren't primarily motivated by a desire to take part in democracy. They are mostly coming to participate in peace and prosperity.<br />The Beginning of Isolation<br />It doesn't matter if Europeans seek their happiness in capitalism, the quest for more prosperity, or socialism, the quest to fairly distribute more prosperity. The desire is the same -- for a life that is better than one focused solely on survival. But that is also why that quest necessarily implies erecting barriers. Because in today's world -- and, given population growth, tomorrow's as well -- our resources are not nearly plentiful enough for everybody to reach European levels of prosperity.<br />The very first bottle of wine thus marks the beginning of the isolation that leads to prosperity, allows it to grow and ensures that it will continue. But it also marks the beginning of our responsibility for the barbed-wire fences on the <a href='160.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:13'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='40.7496988,-73.9737561'>European Union</a>'s external borders.

But with the weather still holding this fall, more are likely to attempt the journey on rickety vessels overcrowded with suffering. The painful images will continue to pull at our hearts and consciences. The images are clear and in sharp focus, and they demand answers that are just as focused: What should be done? The images demand quick, simple answers to stop the dying -- but also to stop the flood of images that are inconveniencing Europeans, standing as they do in marked contrast to the image we have of our civilized societies.<br />In contrast to the 1990s, empathy and sympathy for the refugees is widespread today. That is commendable, but it also the product of our desire to no longer be forced into feeling pity.<br />There is always a yearning for clear, good answers. Indeed, that yearning grows in direct correlation with helplessness. But when it comes to asylum policy, nothing is clear, nothing is obviously good, everything is complicated and confusing. Policies that seem just good may also provide false incentives for even greater crowds to come.

Its predecessor, the German Workers&amp;lsquo; Party (DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. The term Nazi is German and stems from Nationalsozialist, due to the pronunciation of Latin -tion- as -tsion- in German (rather than -shon- as it is in English), with German Z being pronounced as &amp;lsquo;ts&amp;lsquo; as well.The party was founded out of the current of the far-right racist völkisch German nationalist movement and the violent anti-communist Freikorps paramilitary culture that fought against the uprisings of communist revolutionaries in post-World War I Germany. The party was created by Anton Drexler as a means to draw workers away from communism and into völkisch nationalism. Initially, Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business, anti-bourgeois, and anti-capitalist rhetoric, although such aspects were later downplayed in order to gain the support of industrial entities, and in the 1930&amp;lsquo;s the party&amp;lsquo;s focus shifted to anti-Semitic and anti-Marxist');">Nazi Party</a> regime -- when making the moral case for the need to accept refugees.

His work contributed to the conceptual revolution that led to the modern evolutionary synthesis of Mendelian genetics, systematics, and Darwinian evolution, and to the development of the biological species concept.Neither Charles Darwin nor anyone else in his time knew the answer to the species problem: how multiple species could evolve from a single common ancestor. Ernst Mayr approached the problem with a new definition for the concept of species. In his book Systematics and the Origin of Species (1942) he wrote that a species is not just a group of morphologically similar individuals, but a group that can breed only among themselves, excluding all others. When populations within a species become isolated by geography, feeding strategy, mate selection, or other means, they may start to differ from other populations through genetic drift and natural selection, and over time may evolve into new species.

Their smugglers locked them in an apartment where they had to wait for several days. Then they were picked up in a minivan and passengers were taken in groups of 20 in a rubber dinghy to the ship, which was anchored at the waterfront. Al-Assouli says the cutter, which was overcrowded, wasn't even 20 meters long. He says there were many women and around a hundred children on board. It was so cramped he couldn't even stretch out his legs. As the ship began to move, it swayed and al-Assouli became seasick. His daughter cried and said, "I want to go back to my grandma." He tried to comfort his children. "Don't be afraid, we'll soon be in <a href='160.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:57'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='54.5259614,15.2551187'>Europe</a>," he said.<br />'We Didn't Have any Time to React'<br />After four days at sea, another ship showed up that was also carrying smugglers. The men evidently needed the cutter and wanted to transport the refugees for the final miles of the journey in a smaller boat. The passengers refused. In response, the smugglers rammed the cutter without any warning, Assouli says. "We didn't have any time to react." A hole quickly developed in the side of the ship and the cutter filled with water within minutes. The 300 people who had been below decks had no time to escape and drown immediately. Assouli called out to his wife and children but couldn't find them.<br />After the ship sank, around 80 survivors had to fend for themselves in the cold sea. The few survivors who were actually wearing life vests formed a circle and tried to help the others stay afloat. On the third day at sea, the weather grew inclement and the waves swelled until they were meters high.<br />"Each hour we lost another person to the sea," says Abdelmazid Alhila, 24, another survivor. His arms are sunburned and his face full of scars. On the boat he met Mohamed Raad, 25. Neither had brought anything with them to eat, but they did have life vests. On the open sea, they clenched on to one another. Raad began hallucinating and almost took his life vest off. They urinated into bottles and drank from them. They also had to look on as one refugee after the other drowned and as mothers let their babies slide into the water when they ran out of energy.

Francis returned home, began preaching on the streets, and soon amassed a following. His order was endorsed by Pope Innocent III in 1210. He then founded the Order of Poor Clares, which was an enclosed order for women, as well as the Third Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance.

The group released their first public statement on 23 January 2012 in which they called for armed struggle against the Syrian government. The group claims responsibility for the 2012 Aleppo bombings, the January 2012 al-Midan bombing, the March 2012 Damascus bombings and possibly the 10 May 2012 Damascus bombings (see below).The origins of the Al-Nusra Front remain unknown,but the organization appears to have originated in Homs. US intelligence agencies had originally suspected al-Qaeda in Iraq for the bombings in Aleppo and Damascus. Iraq&amp;lsquo;s deputy interior minister said early February that weapons and jihadists were entering Syria from its country. The Front claimed credit for suicide attacks in the Syrian capital of Damascus as well as in Aleppo.

During the first few weeks, some of their mothers were allowed to visit, but the fathers feared they would only be abducted themselves if they tried. ”I waited nine days, and then I could only see him for a few minutes,” says one of the mothers. “He seemed psychologically weak.”<br />In early July an attempt was made to exchange the boys for IS fighters held as prisoners of war. YPG refused to meet in IS-controlled territory, as its exchange delegation had been kidnapped in a similar arrangement on a previous occasion. Instead, a prisoner of war was released to show good will, and IS then agreed to meet in no-man’s-land. However, the IS delegation behaved in an erratic manner, and the two buses arrived with covered windows, one of them looking heavily overloaded. Fearing it might contain an explosive device instead of the boys, the Kurdish delegation withdrew.<br />Out of a total 163 boys, six have managed to escape and 15 have been released after separate negotiations by some of the families (the details of the deal are unknown). This leaves 142 boys still in the hands of IS. Those suspected of being related to YPG have been badly beaten, and one is said to have gone insane. “Our greatest fear now is that there will be air strikes against the school,” says one of the fathers. “Maybe they do not know our boys are there.

The group is composed of and supported by a variety of insurgency groups, including its predecessor, the Mujahideen Shura Council, Al-Qaeda, Jeish al-Fatiheen, Jund al-Sahaba, Katbiyan Ansar Al-Tawhid wal Sunnah, Jeish al-Taiifa al-Mansoura, etc, and other clans whose population is of Sunni faith. It aims to establish a caliphate in the Sunni dominated regions of Iraq.
It claims a presence in the governorates of Baghdad, Al Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Salah ad Din, Ninawa, and parts of Babil and Wasit, etc. It initially claimed Baqubah as its capital.
Between late 2006 and May 2007, the ISI brought the Dora neighborhood of southern Baghdad under its control. Numerous Christian families left, unwilling to pay the Jizya tax. US efforts to drive out the ISI presence stalled in late June, 2007, despite the walling-off of streets and the use of biometric identification technology. By November 2007 the ISI had been removed from Dora, and Assyrian churches could be re-opened.

The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), formed by six countries in 1958. In the intervening years the EU has grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union under its current name in 1993. The latest amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.
The EU operates through a system of supranational independent institutions and intergovernmental negotiated decisions by the member states. Important institutions of the EU include the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, the European Council, the Court of Justice of the European Union, and the European Central Bank.

    						Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, OM, FRS (18 May 1872 – 2 February 1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, and social critic. At various points in his life he considered himself a liberal, a socialist, and a pacifist, but he also admitted that he had never been any of these in any profound sense. He was born in Monmouthshire, into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in Britain.
Russell led the British &quot;revolt against idealism&quot; in the early 20th century. He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege and his friend Ludwig Wittgenstein, and is widely held to be one of the 20th century&#39;s premier logicians. He co-authored, with A. N. Whitehead, Principia Mathematica, an attempt to ground mathematics on logic. His philosophical essay &quot;On Denoting&quot; has been considered a &quot;paradigm of philosophy.&quot; His work has had a considerable influence on logic, mathematics, set theory, linguistics, computer science (see type theory and type system), and philosophy, especially philosophy of language, epistemology, and metaphysics.
Russell was a prominent anti-war activist; he championed
