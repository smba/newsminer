    						Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) is an American multinational corporation which provides Internet-related products and services, including Internet search, cloud computing, software and advertising technologies. Advertising revenues from AdWords generate almost all of the company&#39;s profits.
The company was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while both attended Stanford University. Together, Brin and Page own about 16 percent of the company&#39;s stake. Google was first incorporated as a privately held company on September 4, 1998, and its initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. The company&#39;s mission statement from the outset was &quot;to organize the world&#39;s information and make it universally accessible and useful&quot;, and the company&#39;s unofficial slogan is &quot;Don&#39;t be evil&quot;. In 2006, the company moved to its current headquarters in Mountain View, California.
Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond the company&#39;s core web search engine. The company offers online productivity software including email, an office suite, and social networking. Google&#39;s products extend to the desktop as well, with applications for web
