    						The New York Times (NYT) is an American daily newspaper founded and continuously published in New York City since 1851. The New York Times has won 108 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any news organization. Its website is the most popular American online newspaper website, receiving more than 30 million unique visitors per month.
Although the print version of the paper remains both the largest local metropolitan newspaper in the United States, as well as the third largest newspaper overall, behind The Wall Street Journal and USA Today, its weekday circulation has fallen since 1990 (as have other newspapers) to fewer than one million copies daily. Nicknamed &quot;the Old Gray Lady&quot;, and long regarded within the industry as a national &quot;newspaper of record&quot;, The New York Times is owned by The New York Times Company, which also publishes 18 other newspapers including the International Herald Tribune and The Boston Globe. The company&#39;s chairman is Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., whose family has controlled the paper since 1896.
The paper&#39;s motto, printed in the upper left-hand corner of the front page, is &quot;All the News That&#39;s Fit to Print.&quot; It is organized into sections: News, Opinions, Business,

A Marxist, he was responsible for developing the political theory of Marxism-Leninism, and as the leader of the Bolshevik Party took a senior role in the October Revolution of 1917. Following the Bolsheviks rise to power, Lenin was instrumental in the conversion of the Russian Empire into the Soviet Union, a socialist state governed by a one-party system.
Born into a wealthy family in Simbirsk, Lenin gained an interest in revolutionary leftist politics following the execution of his brother in 1887. Briefly attending the University of Kazan, where he was ejected for his involvement in anti-Tsarist protests, he devoted the next few years to gaining a degree in law and to radical politics, converting to Marxism. In 1893 he moved to Russia&#39;s capital at St. Petersburg, where he continued with his political agitation, becoming a senior figure within the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the

    						Alberto Santos-Dumont (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈsɐ̃tuz duˈmõw̃]; (July 20, 1873 – July 23, 1932) was a Brazilian aviation pioneer. The heir of a wealthy family of coffee producers, Santos Dumont dedicated himself to science studies in Paris, France, where he spent most of his adult life.
Santos-Dumont designed, built, and flew some of the first practical dirigibles, demonstrating that routine, controlled flight was possible. This &quot;conquest of the air&quot;, in particular his winning the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize on October 19, 1901 on a flight that rounded the Eiffel Tower, made him one of the most famous people in the world during the early 20th century.
In addition to his pioneering work in airships, on 23 October 1906 Santos-Dumont, flying the 14-bis or Oiseau de proie (French for &quot;bird of prey&quot;), made the first flight of an airplane to be witnessed by the European press and certified by the Aéro Club de France and the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). Santos-Dumont is considered to be the &quot;Father of Aviation&quot; in Brazil, his native country.
Santos-Dumont occupied the 38th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, from 1931 until his death in 1932.
