A strategy of generous consumer credit, low prices, and high volume allowed Spiegel to accomplish the remarkable feat of expanding its operations during the Great Depression.In 1982, Spiegel was bought by Michael Otto, who took it public in 1987.

    						Alecia Beth Moore (born September 8, 1979), better known by her stage name Pink (often stylized as P!nk), is an American singer-songwriter, musician and actress. After her three-year career with the contemporary R&amp;B girl group Choice, in 2000 she released her first single &quot;There You Go,&quot; from her debut album Can&#39;t Take Me Home. The song garnered commercial success, peaking at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2001, she released her second, more pop rock-oriented, studio album, Missundaztood. The album went on to become a critical and commercial success, with estimated sales of 13 million. The album produced four singles, &quot;Get the Party Started,&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t Let Me Get Me,&quot; &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot; and &quot;Family Portrait,&quot; each entering the Top 20, with &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; being her highest charting solo single (tied with &quot;Most Girls&quot;) until &quot;So What&quot; in 2008, peaking at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.
In November 2003, Pink released her third album Try This. The album was, commercially, less successful than her previous album, but still managed to sell around 3 million copies, making it Pink&#39;s least successful album to date. It produced three singles, &quot;Trouble,&quot; &quot;God Is a DJ&quot; and &quot;Last to Know,&quot;

    						The Federal Foreign Office (German:  Auswärtiges Amt (help·info)), abbreviated AA, is the foreign ministry of Federal Republic of Germany, a federal agency responsible for both the country&#39;s foreign politics and its relationship with the European Union. It is a cabinet-level ministry.
The term &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; was the name of the Foreign Office established in 1870 by the North German Confederation, which then became German Empire&#39;s Foreign Office in 1871. It is still the name of the German foreign ministry today. From 1871 to 1919, the Foreign Office was led by a Foreign Secretary, and since 1919, it has been led by the Foreign Minister of Germany. Since 2009, Guido Westerwelle has served as Foreign Minister, and Werner Hoyer and Cornelia Pieper as Ministers of State. The primary seat of the ministry is at the Werderscher Markt square in the Mitte district, the historic centre of Berlin.
The Auswärtiges Amt was established in 1870 to form the foreign policy of the North German Confederation, and from 1871 of the German Empire. The Foreign Office was originally led by a secretary of state (therefore not called a ministry), while the Chancellor remained in charge of foreign

    						Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American recording artist, entertainer, and businessman. Often referred to as the King of Pop, or by his initials MJ, Jackson is recognized as the most successful entertainer of all time by Guinness World Records. His contribution to music, dance, and fashion, along with a much-publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The seventh child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along with his brothers as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971.
In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. The music videos for his songs, including those of &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, and &quot;Thriller&quot;, were credited with transforming the medium into an art form and a promotional tool, and the popularity of these videos helped to bring the relatively new television channel MTV to fame. With videos such as &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot; he continued to be highly visible on MTV in the 1990s, and also began to forge a reputation as a touring artist. Through stage performances and music videos, Jackson popularized a
