Wright frequently sang background and occasionally lead vocals on stage and in the studio with Pink Floyd (most notably on the songs &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Echoes&quot;, &quot;Wearing the Inside Out&quot;, &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; and &quot;Matilda Mother&quot;).
Though not as prolific a songwriter as his bandmates Roger Waters and David Gilmour, he wrote significant parts of the music for classic albums such as Meddle, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, as well as for Pink Floyd&#39;s final studio album The Division Bell.
Wright is ranked #5 on Digital Dreamdoor&#39;s list of &quot;100 Greatest Rock Keyboardists of All Time&quot; and #8 on MusicRadar&#39;s top 27.
Wright, whose father was head biochemist at Unigate Dairies, grew up in Hatch End, North London and was educated at the Haberdashers&#39; Aske&#39;s School.
Wright taught himself to play guitar at age 12, as well as play trumpet and piano, and took private lessons in musical theory and composition at the Eric

    						Nicholas Berkeley &quot;Nick&quot; Mason (born 27 January 1944) is an English drummer and songwriter, best known for his work with Pink Floyd. He is the only constant member of the band since its formation in 1965. Despite solely writing only a few Pink Floyd songs, Mason has contributed to some of Pink Floyd&#39;s most popular compositions such as &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; and &quot;Echoes&quot;.
He is the only Pink Floyd member to be featured on every one of their albums. It is estimated that as of 2010, the group have sold over 250 million records worldwide, including 74.5 million units sold in the United States.
He also competes in auto racing events, such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
The son of the documentary film maker Bill Mason, he was born in Birmingham but brought up in Hampstead, London (many online biographies mistakenly cite the street address Downshire Hill – sometimes as &quot;the Downshire Hills&quot; – as a district of Birmingham) and attended Frensham Heights School, near Farnham, Surrey. He later studied at the Regent Street Polytechnic (now the University of Westminster), where he teamed up with Roger Waters, Bob Klose and Richard Wright in 1964 to form Pink Floyd&#39;s

    						Reuters (pronounced /ˈrɔɪtərz/) is an international news agency headquartered in London, United Kingdom and a division of Thomson Reuters.
Until 2008 the Reuters news agency formed part of an independent company, Reuters Group plc, which was also a provider of financial market data. Since the acquisition of Reuters Group by The Thomson Corporation in 2008, the Reuters news agency has been a part of Thomson Reuters, forming part of its Markets Division.
The Reuter agency was established in 1851 by Paul Julius Reuter in Britain at the London Royal Exchange. Paul Reuter worked with at a book-publishing firm in Berlin and was involved in distributing radical pamphlets at the beginning of the Revolutions in 1848. These publications brought much attention to Reuter. He later developed a prototype news service in 1849 in which he used electric telegraphy and carrier pigeons. The Reuter’s Telegram Company was later launched. The company initially covered commercial news, serving banks, brokerage houses and business firms.
The first newspaper client to subscribe was the London Morning Advertiser in 1858. Newspaper subscriptions subsequently expanded.
Over the years Reuters&#39; agency has built
