It primarily provided second opinion diagnostic consultations on pathologic specimens such as biopsies from military, veteran, and civilian medical, dental, and veterinary sources. The unique character of the AFIP rested in the expertise of its civilian and military staff of diagnostic pathologists whose daily work consisted of the study of cases that are difficult to diagnose owing to their rarity or their variation from the ordinary.

					So where are the conspirators and lackeys?<br />By Andrew Graham-Yooll<br />For the Herald<br />Mempo Giardinelli’s fatuous reference last Sunday to us being in a pre-coup state reflects his (and my) generational paranoia. To call hatred and resentment what is happening in part of Argentine society and in the badly done-by business community and their “trade union lackeys” is dated and trite barricade sloganeering , especially where the official line in publicity (it does not even grade as propaganda) is the prime promoter of partisan feelings.<br />In fact, it would seem reasonable that any government that has been in office for 11 years should attract a fair volume of lacerating language. That’s called democracy. It is also called political exhaustion in many places. Or does the Sunday columnist want a more silent, toadying and incompetent opposition (he swept through the lot, Pro, Socialists, Radicals) than the bewilderingly inefficient product that fills almost half of the national <a href='119.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Indian National Congress');changeContent('custom-widget-description','The Indian National Congress (abbreviated INC, and commonly known as the Congress) is one of the two major political parties in India, the other being the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

He is currently an Argentine National Senator for La Rioja Province.Carlos S. Menem was born in 1930 in Anillaco, a small town in the mountainous north of La Rioja Province, Argentina. An Arab Argentine, his parents were born in the town of Yabrud (part of the Ottoman Empire at the time, currently in southwestern Syria, near the border with Lebanon). As a young man, he joined his father as a traveling salesman dealing in feed and sundry items. Menem enrolled in the National University of Córdoba, and received the degree of &quot;Abogado&quot;, equivalent to a Bachelor of Laws, in 1955. As a Law student, he became a vocal Peronist, and after President Juan Perón&amp;lsquo;s overthrow that year, he was briefly incarcerated. He later joined the Peronist Party&amp;lsquo;s successor, the Justicialist Party, and was elected President of its La Rioja Province chapter, in 1983.Menem Carlos &quot;el patillas&quot; La Rioja in 1973, a prominent post that left him exposed after the overthrow of President Isabel Martínez de Perón in March 1976. Having been close to La Rioja Bishop Enrique Angelelli (a Third World');">Carlos Menem</a> in the nineties, “neo-liberalism” they called it, much the same as the disguised performance on stage now.  That decade ended in the election victory of the Alianza — a recipe for failure which he probably voted for and, to my regret, I certainly did. At times in his writing the columnist pretends an element of irony, but it hardly works very well.<br />My goodness, Mempo Giardinelli, the use of such remonstrance is 50 years old, quite empty of any political value or strength today. Are we to believe that the poor little Argentine administration, so bereft of any form of defence and incapable even of the saving grace that might be the recognition of its own mistakes is under international threat from hatred and resentment? It would have been more productive for the reading public if the column had made explicit allegations, or maybe just a little hint against specific “lackeys” and the leaders of local branches of Wall Street-based vulture funds hidden in our midst. The column would have been so much more credible.<br />If we are going to add our voices to the chorus claiming that we have lived in democracy since 1983, we should be able to understand due constitutional process and participation in the open political contest. We should not claim that democracy is practised only when our side wins and hence should be free of all questioning.<br />In many countries, from <a href='119.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:5'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='61.52401,105.318756'>Russia</a>, through <a href='119.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:6'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='54.5259614,15.2551187'>Europe</a>, to the <a href='119.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:7'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='37.09024,-95.712891'>United States of America</a> — well, no, let’s leave out the <a href='119.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:8'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='37.09024,-95.712891'>United States of America</a>, seeing as it claims to be the land of the free and has perhaps the largest prison population in the world — the business conspirators and crooks, and their lackeys, face charges and trial if caught.

    						Hamas (Arabic: حماس‎ Ḥamās, &quot;enthusiasm&quot;, an acronym of حركة المقاومة الاسلامية Ḥarakat al-Muqāwamah al-ʾIslāmiyyah, &quot;Islamic Resistance Movement&quot;) is the Palestinian Sunni Islamic or Islamist political party that governs the Gaza Strip. Hamas also has a military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. Since June 2007 Hamas has governed the Gaza portion of the Palestinian Territories, after it won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Parliament in the January 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections and then defeated the Fatah political organization in a series of violent clashes. The European Union, the United States, Canada, Israel and Japan classify Hamas as a terrorist organization, while the Arab nations and countries such as Russia and Turkey do not.
Based on the principles of Islamic fundamentalism gaining momentum throughout the Arab world in the 1980s, Hamas was founded in 1987 (during the First Intifada) as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Co-founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin stated in 1987 and the Hamas Charter affirmed in 1988 that Hamas was founded to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation and to establish an Islamic state in the area that is now Israel,

    						The Indian National Congress (abbreviated INC, and commonly known as the Congress) is one of the two major political parties in India, the other being the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It is the largest and one of the oldest democratic political parties in the world. The party&#39;s modern liberal platform is largely considered center-left in the Indian political spectrum. Founded in 1885 by members of the occultist movement Theosophical Society—Allan Octavian Hume, Dadabhai Naoroji, Dinshaw Wacha, Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee, Surendranath Banerjee, Monomohun Ghose, Mahadev Govind Ranade and William Wedderburn—the Indian National Congress became the leader of the Indian Independence Movement, with over 15 million members and over 70 million participants in its struggle against British rule in India. After independence in 1947, it became the nation&#39;s dominant political party, led by the Nehru-Gandhi family for the most part; major challenges for party leadership have only recently formed.
In the 2009 general elections, the Congress emerged as the single largest party in the Lok Sabha, with 205 of its candidates getting elected to the 543-member house. Consequently it, along with a
