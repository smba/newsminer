A son of Michael and Artemina Beller Doolin, he left home in 1881 and became a cowboy in Indian Territory. He was hired by cattleman Oscar D.

He has been a member of three commercially successful bands: the James Gang, Barnstorm, and the Eagles. He has also experienced success as a solo artist and prolific session musician, especially with B.B. King and Dan Fogelberg.
A native of Wichita, Kansas, Walsh and his family lived in Columbus, Ohio for a number of years. His mother was a classically trained pianist. When Walsh was twelve years old the family moved to New York City. Later, Walsh moved to Montclair, New Jersey and attended Montclair High School there. While attending Kent State University, he spent time in various bands playing around the Cleveland area, including The Measles. Walsh began a lifelong hobby of amateur (&quot;ham&quot;) radio while living in New York City.
In January 1968 he replaced Glen Schwartz as lead guitarist for the James Gang, an American power trio. Walsh proved to be the band&#39;s star attraction, noted for his innovative rhythm playing and creative guitar riffs. In particular he was known for hot-wiring the pickups on his electric guitars to create his trademark &quot;attack&quot; sound. The James

    						The Royal Society of Edinburgh is Scotland&#39;s national academy of science and letters. It is a registered charity, operating on a wholly independent and non-party-political basis and providing public benefit throughout Scotland. Established in 1783, it has since then drawn upon the strengths and expertise of its Fellows, of which there are currently more than 1500.
The Society covers a broader selection of fields than the Royal Society of London including literature and history. Unlike similar organisations in the rest of the UK, the Fellowship includes people from a wide range of disciplines - science &amp; technology, arts, humanities, medicine, social science, business and public service. This breadth of expertise makes the Royal Society of Edinburgh unique in the UK.
At the start of the 18th century, Edinburgh&#39;s intellectual climate fostered many clubs and societies (see Scottish Enlightenment). Though there were several that treated the arts, sciences and medicine, the most prestigious was the Society for the Improvement of Medical Knowledge, commonly referred to as the Medical Society of Edinburgh, co-founded by the mathematician Colin Maclaurin in 1731.

    						Michael Tuomey (September 29, 1805–March 30, 1857) was the State Geologist of South Carolina from 1844 to 1847, and the first State Geologist of Alabama, appointed in 1848 and serving until his death. His early descriptions and maps of the Birmingham District&#39;s unique coincidence of mineral resources for the making of steel opened the way for the early industrial development of the state.
Michael was the son of Thomas and Nora (Foley) Tuomey of Cork, Ireland and was largely home-schooled in his youth. His natural talents as an observer combined with an interest in natural science led him to study biology. He taught schools in England before immigrating to Somerset County, Maryland in the early 1830s. He farmed and served as a private tutor for a while, then entered the Rensselaer Institute at Troy, New York in 1835. There he discovered the emerging scientific field of geology and, though he graduated from the institute that same year, made it his life&#39;s study.
Tuomey worked briefly as a field engineer for the railroads in North Carolina, then married the former Sarah E. Handy of Maryland in 1837 and returned to teaching, opening his own school in Petersburg, Virginia. On the
