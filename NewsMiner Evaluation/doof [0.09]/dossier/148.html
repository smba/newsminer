His family were prominent republicans in the South Down area in the 1920s, taking an active part in the IRA during the War of Independence and the Civil War. The Quinns were prosperous merchants in Newry, County Down, but were forced to move south to Dublin in the 1930s where Quinn&amp;lsquo;s father built a successful business career. Quinn was educated at Saint Michael&amp;lsquo;s College, Ballsbridge, and Blackrock College where he was academically successful and an outstanding athlete and a member of the Senior Cup rugby team. From an early age, he was interested in art and won the all-Ireland Texaco Children&amp;lsquo;s Art competition. This led him to study architecture at University College Dublin (UCD) in 1964 and later at the School of Ekistics in Athens.In 1965, Quinn joined the Labour Party working for Michael O&amp;lsquo;Leary&amp;lsquo;s successful campaign in Dublin North–Central.

Turkey labeled the organization as an ethnic secessionist organization that uses terrorism and the threat of force against both civilian and military targets for the purpose of achieving its political goal.
