It never had an official name such as &quot;Indian Empire&quot;. It was called &quot;India&quot; and under that name was a founding member of the League of Nations, and a participating nation in the Summer Olympics in 1900, 1920, 1928, 1932, and 1936.The system of governance was instituted in 1858, when the rule of the British East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen Victoria (and who, in 1876, was proclaimed Empress of India), and lasted until 1947, when the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two sovereign dominion states, the Union of India (later the Republic of India) and the Dominion of Pakistan (later the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the eastern half of which, still later, became the People&amp;lsquo;s Republic of Bangladesh).

    						Carlos Saúl Menem (born July 2, 1930) is an Argentine politician who was President of Argentina from 1989 to 1999. He is currently an Argentine National Senator for La Rioja Province.
Carlos S. Menem was born in 1930 in Anillaco, a small town in the mountainous north of La Rioja Province, Argentina. An Arab Argentine, his parents were born in the town of Yabrud (part of the Ottoman Empire at the time, currently in southwestern Syria, near the border with Lebanon). As a young man, he joined his father as a traveling salesman dealing in feed and sundry items. Menem enrolled in the National University of Córdoba, and received the degree of &quot;Abogado&quot;, equivalent to a Bachelor of Laws, in 1955. As a Law student, he became a vocal Peronist, and after President Juan Perón&#39;s overthrow that year, he was briefly incarcerated. He later joined the Peronist Party&#39;s successor, the Justicialist Party, and was elected President of its La Rioja Province chapter, in 1983.

It operates as a network comprising both a multinational, stateless army and a radical Sunni Muslim movement calling for global Jihad and a strict interpretation of sharia law. It has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, various other countries, the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, and NATO (see below).
Al-Qaeda has attacked civilian and military targets in various countries. For example, it carried out the September 11 attacks, 1998 US embassy bombings and the 2002 Bali bombings. The US government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the War on Terror. With the loss of key leaders, culminating in the death of Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda&#39;s operations have devolved from actions that were controlled from the top-down, to actions by franchise associated groups, to actions of lone wolf operators.
