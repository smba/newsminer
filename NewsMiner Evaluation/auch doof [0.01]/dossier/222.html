I found myself in the cafeteria on a recent afternoon indulging myself as a way to bridge the gap between lunch and dinner: A small piece of pleasure for the affordable price of 1.20.<br />But who really needs red wine to live? Or a VW Golf? Or strawberry cake? Nobody. They are certainly not necessary for survival. But that is what we have decided to spend our money on -- instead of sending it to places where people are dying because they don't have enough. Places where people have no future, leading them to flee. It is our red wine, Golfs and cakes against their lives.<br />That is <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:11'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='54.5259614,15.2551187'>Europe</a>'s original sin, one into which pretty much everyone on the Continent is born, whether we like it or not. The gray area begins with the first bottle of red wine that nobody needs. It marks the loss of innocence, no matter what kind of asylum policies one supports: strict or loose, with or without razor wire. It marks the moment when we begin talking about prosperity rather than survival, and about how much of that prosperity we are willing to sacrifice. It is not, of course, a discussion as to whether we are prepared to give up our prosperity altogether.<br />Striving for happiness is programmed into humanity's DNA. Searching for that happiness in material consumption is the path chosen by the overwhelming majority of Europeans. It is also the path subscribed to by the majority of refugees seeking to make a new start in the <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:12'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='40.7496988,-73.9737561'>European Union</a>. Most of them aren't primarily motivated by a desire to take part in democracy. They are mostly coming to participate in peace and prosperity.<br />The Beginning of Isolation<br />It doesn't matter if Europeans seek their happiness in capitalism, the quest for more prosperity, or socialism, the quest to fairly distribute more prosperity. The desire is the same -- for a life that is better than one focused solely on survival. But that is also why that quest necessarily implies erecting barriers. Because in today's world -- and, given population growth, tomorrow's as well -- our resources are not nearly plentiful enough for everybody to reach European levels of prosperity.<br />The very first bottle of wine thus marks the beginning of the isolation that leads to prosperity, allows it to grow and ensures that it will continue. But it also marks the beginning of our responsibility for the barbed-wire fences on the <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:13'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='40.7496988,-73.9737561'>European Union</a>'s external borders.

But with the weather still holding this fall, more are likely to attempt the journey on rickety vessels overcrowded with suffering. The painful images will continue to pull at our hearts and consciences. The images are clear and in sharp focus, and they demand answers that are just as focused: What should be done? The images demand quick, simple answers to stop the dying -- but also to stop the flood of images that are inconveniencing Europeans, standing as they do in marked contrast to the image we have of our civilized societies.<br />In contrast to the 1990s, empathy and sympathy for the refugees is widespread today. That is commendable, but it also the product of our desire to no longer be forced into feeling pity.<br />There is always a yearning for clear, good answers. Indeed, that yearning grows in direct correlation with helplessness. But when it comes to asylum policy, nothing is clear, nothing is obviously good, everything is complicated and confusing. Policies that seem just good may also provide false incentives for even greater crowds to come.

Its predecessor, the German Workers&amp;lsquo; Party (DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. The term Nazi is German and stems from Nationalsozialist, due to the pronunciation of Latin -tion- as -tsion- in German (rather than -shon- as it is in English), with German Z being pronounced as &amp;lsquo;ts&amp;lsquo; as well.The party was founded out of the current of the far-right racist völkisch German nationalist movement and the violent anti-communist Freikorps paramilitary culture that fought against the uprisings of communist revolutionaries in post-World War I Germany. The party was created by Anton Drexler as a means to draw workers away from communism and into völkisch nationalism. Initially, Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business, anti-bourgeois, and anti-capitalist rhetoric, although such aspects were later downplayed in order to gain the support of industrial entities, and in the 1930&amp;lsquo;s the party&amp;lsquo;s focus shifted to anti-Semitic and anti-Marxist');">Nazi Party</a> regime -- when making the moral case for the need to accept refugees.

His work contributed to the conceptual revolution that led to the modern evolutionary synthesis of Mendelian genetics, systematics, and Darwinian evolution, and to the development of the biological species concept.Neither Charles Darwin nor anyone else in his time knew the answer to the species problem: how multiple species could evolve from a single common ancestor. Ernst Mayr approached the problem with a new definition for the concept of species. In his book Systematics and the Origin of Species (1942) he wrote that a species is not just a group of morphologically similar individuals, but a group that can breed only among themselves, excluding all others. When populations within a species become isolated by geography, feeding strategy, mate selection, or other means, they may start to differ from other populations through genetic drift and natural selection, and over time may evolve into new species.

Spiegel eventually became one of the most important firms in the mail-order industry, and arguably the first. In 1904, Joseph and his son, Arthur, switched to mail order. Spiegel mailed its first catalog in 1905. By 1925, it had 10 million customers. Before the Great Depression began, Spiegel (which then sold women&amp;lsquo;s&amp;lsquo; clothing as well as furniture) was selling over $20 million yearly through the mail.

He lived in Madrid from 1871 to 1878, where he began his career as a journalist (adopting the pen-name &quot;Clarín&quot; in 1875) and he graduated with the thesis El Derecho y la Moralidad (Law and Morality) in 1878.

In 1883 he returned to Oviedo to take up a position as professor of Roman law.Above all, Clarín is the author of La Regenta, his masterpiece and one of the best novels of the 19th century. It is a long work, similar to Flaubert&amp;lsquo;s Madame Bovary, one of its influences. Other influences included Naturalism and Krausism, a philosophical current which promoted the cultural and ethical regeneration of Spain.La Regenta is special for its great wealth of characters and secondary stories, while the main character&amp;lsquo;s description is left slightly unfocused and vague.

People from all over the world would come during the last month of the summer to many different wine farmers to help them harvest the grapes and make more beautiful wine. It looked like fun; working abroad and helping to make wine. La Provence, especially, has a very romantic feeling in its name. When I think about <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:2'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='26.197144,-81.8138705'>Provence</a>, I think about wine, lavender and good food.<br />For years, I have been wondering why winemakers in <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:3'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='38.963745,35.243322'>Turkey</a> do not introduce a system similar to that used in <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:4'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='26.197144,-81.8138705'>Provence</a>. Then I heard about the Buğday association, which has a project called TaTuTa. The Buğday association focuses on offering local and organic food and raising awareness in <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:5'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='38.963745,35.243322'>Turkey</a> about the cultivation and consumption of organic products.

The organization is quite successful and the number of TaTuTa farms is growing every year.<br />This year, I went to Dikili, a place that did not impress me too much.

I never knew this, but here I learned that there are peppers for breakfast, hot peppers, sweet peppers, peppers for frying, peppers for filling and peppers to grill. All of them are different and all of them were here in this garden. All the vegetables are coming from their own land and for sure, you can taste it.<br />Vinocasa is not the typical kind of hotel where you feel like a guest and the staff treats you like that. On the contrary, staying in Vinocasa is as if you are at home with the advantage that you do not have to make your bed or clean up the kitchen. I loved it and I am sure that the relaxed treatment will be the key of success for this place.<br />September/24/2014<br />

Now, its founders want to create a new development on the site. It is to cater to former clubbers and preserve an element of 1990s <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:3'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.5200066,13.404954'>Berlin</a>. But the hurdles are high.<br />It is the 56th visit he has made to some kind of local authority, Juval Dieziger says after a bit of arithmetic. It's not, he notes, the kind of life he had envisioned for himself.<br />Dieziger is a club owner. He used to run Bar 25, a nightclub that helped ensure that <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:4'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.5200066,13.404954'>Berlin</a> became known around the world for over-the-top nights on the town -- nights that often went from Friday to Monday. He's wears a shaggy black and gray beard that reaches almost to his chest; locks of his dark hair stick out from beneath his cap. His t-shirt has holes in it and he looks a bit like the captain of a stranded pirate ship.<br />A taxi is standing by and Dieziger is waiting for business partner Christoph Klenzendorf, with whom he opened Bar 25 some 10 years ago and, later, the almost equally legendary club KaterHolzig. Together, they are visiting the building permits office in <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:5'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.5200066,13.404954'>Berlin</a>'s <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:6'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.4995669,13.4314194'>Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg</a> district. The issues to be discussed are technical in nature -- minimum distances allowed between buildings, a bothersome noise study and construction permits.<br />Lifting the Underground into the Mainstream<br />As tedious as they are, the appointments with bureaucracy are necessary. Now in their forties, Dieziger and Klenzendorf are no longer intent on just running their own club. They want to build an urban district in central <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:7'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.5200066,13.404954'>Berlin</a>, along the banks of the <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:8'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='51.35,14.883333'>Spree</a> at a location known as Holzmarkt. The quarter will provide a new home for a lifestyle that has thus far existed only in the underground world of the clubs, at night and in exclusive places that aren't accessible to all. After 25 years of club culture in <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:9'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.5200066,13.404954'>Berlin</a>, this underground culture is now being given a place in the world above -- and in a prime location, too.<br />The property is the size of two-and-a-half football fields. In early 2012, Klenzendorf and Dieziger founded the Holzmarkt Cooperative Society, landed an investor in the form of a Swiss pension fund and purchased the property. The price tag was well above 10 million.<br />The site they acquired was one of the most sought-after open spaces in the city, miraculously beating out investors and hedge funds that had likewise shown interest. Since their coup, they have been known as the "business hippies."<br />But now comes the hard part -- actually building the development. The plans foresee a technology center for start-ups, a student dormitory, a shopping village, a market, a trail along the river bank, warehouse space for music studios and workshops, a restaurant, a nightclub, a hotel, a fish farm, a gardening area and, given that everyone is getting a little older, a daycare center.<br />Klenzendorf finally arrives. For his meeting with the planning office, he wears jogging shorts and hiking boots. In the taxi, Dieziger tries to explain the issues to be addressed at the permits office, but with Klenzendorf's mobile phone ringing non-stop, it's an impossible task. Things from the night before need to be discussed and he's having trouble concentrating, he says.<br />Up front in the passenger seat, Mario Husten is speaking urgently on his mobile phone with the group's lawyer. There's been water damage in their new nightclub and the insurance company is refusing to pay.<br />In an earlier life, Husten was an executive at a major newspaper publishing house, where he was responsible for operations in <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:11'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.0055148,37.9587494'>Eastern Europe</a>. Klenzendorf and Dieziger brought him on board two years ago because he's a fast thinker, persuasive and knows what the term "controlling" actually means.<br />The Roots of <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:12'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.5200066,13.404954'>Berlin</a>'s Non-Stop Party Culture<br />"Shit, things are jinxed right now," Husten says as he ends the call. Dieziger looks out the open taxi window. Have they bit off more than they can chew? Starting Bar 25 was a lot easier. All they had to do was secure an interim use lease, drive a motor home onto the property for the stereo system and drink sales, build a few wooden huts and a dance floor. Then you had to put the right people in place as doorkeepers and let in the right kinds of drug dealers. The two proved highly adept and the result was one of <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:14'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.5200066,13.404954'>Berlin</a>'s most spectacular clubs.<br />A new party culture sprouted -- one in which excess was no longer the exception, but the rule. Guests at Bar 25 didn't just lose a few hours on a Saturday. They went to the club for the entire weekend, often staying until Monday afternoon. Those who went in, people said, didn't come out.<br />Originally, they rented the property relatively cheaply from the city's refuse disposal company, which hadn't been using the land. It had always been clear to Bar 25's owners that the city would eventually sell the property to investors for the development of high-end apartments or office towers, as happened with other empty lots along the river. When the sale process began at the end of 2010, Bar 25 had to move out after a long back-and-forth. Dieziger and Klenzendorf moved directly across the river to an abandoned factory where they ran the new KaterHolzig nightclub and restaurant for two-and-a-half years.<br />The Bet<br />The whole time, though, they wanted to get their old property back and they began wondering if they might be able to buy it themselves. Maybe the city would sell it to them cheaply? They knew how important the kind of clubs they run are for the city's reputation, especially under Mayor <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Klaus Wowereit');changeContent('custom-widget-description','Klaus Wowereit (born 1 October 1953 in Berlin) is a German politician, member of the SPD (Social Democratic Party), and has been the Mayor of Berlin since the 2001 state elections, where his party won a plurality of the votes, 29.7%. He served as President of the Bundesrat (the fourth highest office in Germany) in 2001/02. His SPD-led coalition was re-elected in the 2006 elections. He is also sometimes mentioned as a possible SPD candidate for the Chancellorship of Germany (Kanzlerkandidatur) in the next German federal election.Until 1973, Klaus Wowereit attended the Ulrich-von-Hutten-Oberschule in Berlin-Lichtenrade. Afterwards, he studied law at the Free University Berlin (State Exams, 1981 and 1984).After 3 years as a civil servant in the Senate office of the Interior, Wowereit stood for election as municipal councillor in the Tempelhof district. At the age of 30, he was, therefore, the youngest councilor in the city of Berlin. After eleven years as a District Councillor he stood for the Berlin House of Deputies (Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin) which serves as the City&amp;lsquo;s Landtag or state legislature in 1995. In December 1999, he was elected chairman of the SPD parliamentary group');">Klaus Wowereit</a>, who likes to promote <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:16'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.5200066,13.404954'>Berlin</a>'s party culture. They started working on a development concept.<br />The concept quickly began to focus on how one could age within the club culture. Christoph Klenzendorf recently returned from a vacation in <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:17'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='39.6952629,3.0175712'>Majorca</a> with his girlfriend and his 15-year-old daughter. His girlfriend goes by the name Steffi-Lotta, and she worked the door at Bar 25. Her attire is almost circus-like in its outlandishness and she has a raspy voice. Her appearance is the opposite of Sven Marquardt, the tattooed and pierced doorman at the famous Berghain nightclub, a man who is notorious for his strict door policy. But getting past Steffi-Lotta wasn't particularly easy either.<br />Now 40, Klenzendorf has been at this for 20 years -- the partying, the staying awake for several days at a time, the drugs. Drugs were an integral part of the Bar 25 lifestyle -- mostly ecstasy, but also LSD and cocaine. Without them, it wouldn't be possible to party through an entire weekend. And in no other place in <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:19'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.5200066,13.404954'>Berlin</a> could you see as many people high at one time as you could at Bar 25.<br />The End of an Era?<br />Klenzendorf says he feels this era may be ending and that it will soon be replaced by a new, different generation. Recently, they celebrated the 10-year-anniversary of Bar 25 and, concurrently, the opening of the new club at Holzmarkt. Again the party lasted for days and Klenzendorf says it took him a long time to recover, but he was also blissful. The feeling of being among family had returned. They are many of them working together -- indeed, that is why Klenzendorf believes the Herculean project they have set out for themselves may actually succeed. Some 10 corporations have been formed under the collective, all led by friends and companions.<br />In August, they set up a temporary Bar 25-like establishment in a forest on a lake in Gabicz, a Polish village just across the border. About an hour's drive from <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:20'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.5200066,13.404954'>Berlin</a>, it was a music and performance festival for 3,000 people. "At the end of the day, this kind of partying is the foundation for everything we do. We have to keep that in mind, even if we're doing something different now," he says.<br />The different thing they are now doing explains why they are now on the eighth floor of the planning office. They intend to explain to the district councilor for building and planning, Hans Panhoff, that the bureaucracy is killing them. They say it's simply too stressful and inefficient to have to keep traveling from one agency to the next -- to the building inspection department, to city planning, to the environmental office, underground engineering and the office for the protection of historical monuments. They require an individual appointment for each agency, and often, the different agencies have no idea what the others are doing. The people behind the cooperative have analyzed the agency procedures and would like to help optimize them.<br />Dieziger and Klenzendorf both address the city councilor at the same time. In response, Panhoff puts his hands up, explaining that last night was the first he had spent at home again since being placed under police protection after he called the police when the situation threatened to escalate in a <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:21'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.5200066,13.404954'>Berlin</a> school that was occupied by refugees. Now left-wing extremists are threatening him.<br />As such, he says, his appointment with the urban hippies is among the more pleasant duties his job entails. He likes their courage, he says, and the fact that they repeatedly ask questions when they don't understand something. And there are many things that are difficult to understand: fine print, regulations and a tangle of abbreviations.<br />In 1980, Panhoff himself occupied a house in <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:22'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='52.5200066,13.404954'>Berlin</a>, a phenomenon common during the 1970s, '80s and, after reunification, in the early '90s. Today he's a member of the district council representing the <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Green Party of the United States');changeContent('custom-widget-description','The Green Party of the United States (GPUS) is a national US-American political party founded in 1991 as a voluntary association of state green parties.

The Association of State Green Parties (ASGP), a forerunner organization, first gained widespread public attention during Ralph Nader&amp;lsquo;s United States presidential campaigns in 1996 and 2000.The Green Party in the United States has won elected office at the local level; most winners of public office in the United States who are considered Greens have won nonpartisan elections. The highest-ranking Greens ever elected in the nation were: John Eder, a member of the Maine House of Representatives until his defeat in November 2006; Audie Bock, elected to the California State Assembly in 1999 but switched her registration to Independent seven months later running as an independent in the 2000 election; and Richard Carroll, elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives in 2008 but switched parties to become a Democrat five');">Green Party of the United States</a>. In these young men standing in his office, he sees something of a weapon against what he calls the city's investor-friendly policies -- namely the sell-out of the best pieces of property to developers who then build glass offices and river-view penthouses.<br />1<br />

					Education with a debt sentence<br />For-profit colleges as American dream drushers and factories of debt<br />22 September, by Hannah Appel and  Astra Taylor<br />Imagine corporations that intentionally target low-income single mothers as ideal customers. Imagine that these same companies claim to sell tickets to the American dream — gainful employment, the chance for a middle class life. Imagine that the fine print on these tickets, once purchased, reveals them to be little more than debt contracts, profitable to the corporation’s investors, but disastrous for its customers. And imagine that these corporations receive tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to do this dirty work. Now, know that these corporations actually exist and are universities.<br />Over the last three decades, the price of a year of college has increased by more than 1,200% . In the past, American higher education has always been associated with upward mobility, but with student loan debt quadrupling between 2003 and 2013, it’s time to ask whether education alone can really move people up the class ladder.

All three are concerned with generating revenue, but only the for-profit model exists primarily to enrich its owners. The largest of these institutions are often publicly traded, nationally franchised corporations legally beholden to maximize profit for their shareholders before maximizing education for their students. While commercial vocational programs have existed since the nineteenth century, for-profit colleges in their current form are a relatively new phenomenon that began to boom with a series of initial public offerings in the 1990s, followed quickly by deregulation of the sector as the millennium approached. <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','George W.

The fact is that for-profits like Corinthian exemplify all the contradictions of the free-market model that reformers present as the only solution to the current crisis in higher education: not only are these schools 90% dependent on taxpayer money, but tenure doesn’t exist, there are no faculty unions, most courses are offered online with low overhead costs, and students are treated as “customers.”<br />It’s also worth remembering that at “public” universities, it is now nearly impossible for working class or even middle class students to graduate without debt. This sad state of affairs — so the common version of the story goes — is the consequence of economic hard-times, which require belt tightening and budget cuts. And so it has come to pass that strapped community colleges are now turning away would-be enrollees who wind up in the embrace of for-profits that proceed to squeeze every penny they can from them and the public purse as well. (All the while, of course, this same tale provides for-profits with a cover: they are offering a public service to a marginalized and needy population no one else will touch.)<br />The standard narrative that, in the face of shrinking tax revenues, public universities must relentlessly raise tuition rates turns out, however, to be full of holes. As political theorist Robert Meister points out, this version of the story ignores the complicity of university leaders in the process. Many of them were never passive victims of privatization; instead, they saw tuition, not taxpayer funding, as the superior and preferred form of revenue growth.<br />Beginning in the 1990s, universities, public and private, began working ever more closely with Wall Street, which meant using tuition payments not just as direct revenue but also as collateral for debt-financing.

Meister is German for &quot;Master&quot;, referring to the academic title Magister in theologia he obtained in Paris. Coming into prominence during the Avignon Papacy and a time of increased tensions between the Franciscans and Eckhart&amp;lsquo;s Dominican Order of Friars Preachers, he was brought up on charges later in life before the local Franciscan-led Inquisition.Tried as a heretic by Pope John XXII, his &quot;Defence&quot; is famous for his reasoned arguments to all challenged articles of his writing and his refutation of heretical intent. He purportedly died before his verdict was received, although no record of his death or burial site has ever been discovered. He was well known for his work with pious lay groups such as the Friends of God and succeeded by his more circumspect disciples of John Tauler and Henry Suso. In his study of medieval humanism, Richard Southern includes him along with Saint Bede the Venerable and Saint Anselm as emblematic of the intellectual spirit of the Middle');">Meister Eckhart</a> suggests, “Add up the lifetime debt service that former students will pay on $1 trillion, over and above the principal they borrow, and you could run a very good public university system for what we are paying capital markets to fund an ever-worsening one."<br />You are not a loan<br />The big problem of how we finance education won’t be solved overnight. But one group is attempting to provide both immediate aid to students like Nathan Hornes and a vision for rethinking debt as a systemic issue.

Depending on the location and program, the school has day, evening, or weekend classes.In 2007, Corinthian Colleges completed the process of unifying all its schools under the Everest brand name.

This granted nearly 3,000 former students no-strings-attached debt relief.<br />The authors of this article have both been part of this effort. To date, the Rolling Jubilee has abolished nearly $20 million dollars of medical and educational debt by taking advantage of a little-known trade secret: debt is often sold to debt collectors for mere pennies on the dollar. A medical bill that was originally $1,000 might sell to a debt collector for 4% of its sticker price, or $40. This allowed the Rolling Jubilee project to make a multi-million dollar impact with a budget of approximately $700,000 raised in large part through small individual donations.<br />The point of the Rolling Jubilee is simple enough: we believe people shouldn’t have to go into debt for basic needs. For the last four decades, easy access to credit has masked stagnating wages and crumbling social services, forcing many Americans to debt-finance necessities like college, health care, and housing, while the creditor class has reaped enormous rewards. But while we mean the Jubilee’s acts to be significant, we know it is not a sustainable solution to the problem at hand. There is no way to buy and abolish all the odious debt sloshing around our economy, nor would we want to. Given the way our economy is structured, people would start slipping into the red again the minute their debts were wiped out.<br />The Rolling Jubilee instead raises a question: If a ragtag group of activists can find a way to provide immediate relief to even a few thousand defrauded students, why can’t the government?<br />The <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Consumer Financial Protection Bureau');changeContent('custom-widget-description','The United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is the federal agency that holds primary responsibility for regulating consumer protection in the United States.

It is the United Kingdom&amp;lsquo;s fourth largest Christian denomination, with around 300,000 members and 6,000 churches. Congregations in the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, Malta and Gibraltar also form part of the British Methodist Church. According to historians such as Elie Halevy, Eric J. Hobsbawm and E. P. Thompson, Methodism had a major impact in the early decades of the making of the English working class (1760–1820).Methodism arose as a revival movement in the 18th century, largely within the Church of England.The main Methodist movement outside the Church of England was associated with Howell Harris in Wales. This was to become The Calvinistic Methodist Church. Another branch of the Methodist revival was under the ministry of Rev. George Whitfield, resulting in the Countess of Huntingdon&amp;lsquo;s Connexion. A later development of Whitfield&amp;lsquo;s ministry was the Free Church of England, a result of Whitfield&amp;lsquo;s influence upon the Church of England.The largest branch of Methodism');">Methodist Church of Great Britain</a> ministers must have bought up lots of rum in that time period!<br />Actually no, that’s a silly conclusion to draw. What’s really going on is that both quantities — Methodist ministers and Cuban rum — were driven upwards by other factors, such as population growth.<br />In reaching that incorrect conclusion, we’ve made the far-too-common mistake of confusing correlation with causation.<br />Two quantities are said to be correlated if both increase and decrease together (“positively correlated”), or if one increases when the other decreases and vice-versa (“negatively correlated”).<br />Correlation is readily detected through statistical measurements of the <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Lester B. Pearson');changeContent('custom-widget-description','Lester Bowles &quot;Mike&quot; Pearson, PC, OM, CC, OBE (23 April 1897 – 27 December 1972) was a Canadian professor, historian, civil servant, statesman, diplomat, and politician, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for organizing the United Nations Emergency Force to resolve the Suez Canal Crisis. He was the 14th Prime Minister of Canada from 22 April 1963 to 20 April 1968, as the head of two back-to-back minority governments following elections in 1963 and 1965.During Pearson&amp;lsquo;s time as Prime Minister, his minority government introduced universal health care, student loans, the Canada Pension Plan, the Order of Canada, and the current Canadian flag. During his tenure, Prime Minister Pearson also convened the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. With these accomplishments, together with his ground-breaking work at the United Nations and in international diplomacy, Pearson is generally considered among the most influential Canadians of the 20th century.Pearson was born in the town of Newtonbrook (now part of Toronto), the son of Annie Sarah (née Bowles) and Edwin Arthur Pearson, a Methodist (later United Church of Canada) minister. He was brother to Vaughan Whitier Pearson');">Lester B. Pearson</a>’s correlation coefficient, which indicates how tightly locked together the two quantities are, ranging from -1 (perfectly negatively correlated) through 0 (not at all correlated) and up to 1 (perfectly positively correlated).<br />But just because two quantities are correlated does not necessarily mean that one is directly causing the other to change. Correlation does not imply causation, just like cloudy weather does not imply rainfall, even though the reverse is true. If two quantities are correlated then there might well be a genuine cause-and-effect relationship (such as rainfall levels and umbrella sales), but maybe other variables are driving both (such as pirate numbers and global warming), or perhaps it’s just coincidence (such as <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:4'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='37.09024,-95.712891'>United States of America</a> cheese consumption and strangulations-by-bedsheet).<br />Even where causation is present, we must be careful not to mix up the cause with the effect, or else we might conclude, for example, that an increased use of heaters causes colder weather.<br />In order to establish cause-and-effect, we need to go beyond the statistics and look for separate evidence (of a scientific or historical nature) and logical reasoning. Correlation may prompt us to go looking for such evidence in the first place, but it is by no means a proof in its own right.<br />Although the above examples were obviously silly, correlation is very often mistaken for causation in ways that are not immediately obvious in the real world. When reading and interpreting statistics, one must take great care to understand exactly what the data and its statistics are implying — and more importantly, what they are not implying.<br />One recent example of the need for caution in interpreting data is the excitement earlier this year surrounding the apparent groundbreaking detection of gravitational waves — an announcement that appears to have been made prematurely, before all the variables that were affecting the data were accounted for.<br />Unfortunately, analysing statistics, probabilities and risks is not a skill set wired into our human intuition, and so is all too easy to be led astray. Entire books have been written on the subtle ways in which statistics can be misinterpreted (or used to mislead). To help keep your guard up, here are some common slippery statistical problems that you should be aware of:<br />1) The Healthy Worker Effect, where sometimes two groups cannot be directly compared on a level playing field.<br />Consider a hypothetical study comparing the health of a group of office-workers with the health of a group of astronauts. If the study shows no significant difference between the two — no correlation between healthiness and working environment — are we to conclude that living and working in space carries no long-term health risks for astronauts?<br />No! The groups are not on the same footing: the astronaut corps screen applicants to find healthy candidates, who then maintain a comprehensive fitness regime in order to proactively combat the effects of living in “microgravity.”<br />We would therefore expect them to be significant healthier than office workers, on average, and should rightly be concerned if they were not.<br />2) Categorization and the Stage Migration Effect — shuffling people between groups can have dramatic effects on statistical outcomes. This is also known as the Will Rogers effect, after the <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:5'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='37.09024,-95.712891'>United States of America</a> comedian who reportedly quipped:<br />“When the Okies left <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:6'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='35.4675602,-97.5164276'>Oklahoma</a> and moved to <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:7'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='36.778261,-119.4179324'>California</a>, they raised the average intelligence level in both states.”<br />To illustrate, imagine dividing a large group of friends into a “short” group and a “tall” group (perhaps in order to arrange them for a photo). Having done so, it’s surprisingly easy to raise the average height of both groups at once.<br />Simply ask the shortest person in the “tall” group to switch over to the “short” group. The “tall”‘ group lose their shortest member, thus bumping up their average height — but the “short” group gain their tallest member yet, and thus also gain in average height.<br />This has major implications in medical studies, where patients are often sorted into “healthy” or “unhealthy” groups in the course of testing a new treatment. If diagnostic methods improve, some very-slightly-unhealthy patients may be recategorized — leading to the health outcomes of both groups improving, regardless of how effective (or not) the treatment is.<br />3) Data mining — when an abundance of data is present, bits and pieces can be cherry-picked to support any desired conclusion. This is bad statistical practice, but if done deliberately can be hard to spot without knowledge of the original, complete data set.<br />Consider fluoride, for instance — in small amounts it is one of the most effective preventative medicines in history, but the positive effect disappears entirely if one only ever considers toxic quantities of fluoride. For similar reasons, it is important that the procedures for a given statistical experiment are fixed in place before the experiment begins and then remain unchanged until the experiment ends.<br />4) Clustering — which is to be expected even in completely random data.<br />Consider a medical study examining how a particular disease, such as cancer or Multiple sclerosis, is geographically distributed. If the disease strikes at random (and the environment has no effect) we would expect to see numerous clusters of patients as a matter of course. If patients are spread out perfectly evenly, the distribution would be most un-random indeed! So the presence of a single cluster, or a number of small clusters of cases, is entirely normal. Sophisticated statistical methods are needed to determine just how much clustering is required to deduce that something in that area might be causing the illness.<br />Unfortunately, any cluster at all — even a non-significant one — makes for an easy (and at first glance, compelling) news headline. Statistical analysis, like any other powerful tool, must be used very carefully — and in particular, one must always be careful when drawing conclusions based on the fact that two quantities are correlated.<br />Instead, we must always insist on separate evidence to argue for cause-and-effect — and that evidence will not come in the form of a single statistical number.<br />Seemingly compelling correlations, say between given genes and schizophrenia or between a high fat diet and heart disease, may turn out to be based on very dubious methodology.<br />We are perhaps as a species cognitively ill prepared to deal with these issues. As Canadian educator Kieran Egan put it in his book “Getting It Wrong From the Beginning”:<br />“The bad news is that our evolution equipped us to live in small, stable, hunter-gatherer societies. We are Pleistocene people, but our languaged brains have created massive, multicultural, technologically sophisticated and rapidly changing societies for us to live in.” In consequence, we must constantly resist the temptation to see meaning in chance and to confuse correlation and causation.<br />Jonathan Borwein (<a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Lil Jon');changeContent('custom-widget-description','Jonathan Smith (born January 27, 1971), better known by his stage name Lil Jon, is an American rapper, music producer, entrepreneur, and international DJ who was a member of the group Lil Jon &amp; The East Side Boyz.

The system provides healthcare to anyone normally legally resident in England, and also any other part of the United Kingdom (should a person from another UK area be travelling in England, for example), with almost all services free at the point of use for all such people.The idea of the NHS being free at the point of use is contained in its core principles from the original NHS set-up, which are non-negotiable at their root but have variously been open to some interpretation over the years. In practice, &quot;free at the point of use&quot; normally means that anyone legitimately fully registered with the system (i.e. in possession of an NHS number), including UK citizens and legal immigrants, can access the full breadth of critical and non-critical medical care without any out-of-pocket payment of any kind.');">National Health Service</a> Executive figures which point to a difficult winter for Minister for Health <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','Leo Varadkar');changeContent('custom-widget-description','Leo Varadkar (born 18 January 1979) is an Irish Fine Gael politician.

					Producer Blog: Tapping into the brain's potential<br />Our producer surveys the promising uses of transcranial direct current stimulation<br />September 23, 2014 4:00PM ET<br />by Joanne Shen @theonlyjshen<br />Let’s face it: the notion of applying electricity to the brain gets a bad rap.

He is renowned for his often dark portrayals of neurotic characters. His twelve Oscar nominations make him the second most nominated actor of all time, behind only Meryl Streep, and tied with Katharine Hepburn.Nicholson has been nominated for an Academy Award twelve times and has won the Academy Award for Best Actor twice: for One Flew Over the Cuckoo&amp;lsquo;s Nest and for As Good as It Gets. He also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the 1983 film Terms of Endearment. He is tied with Walter Brennan for most acting wins by a male actor (three). Nicholson is well known for playing villainous roles such as Jack Torrance in The Shining, Frank Costello in The Departed, and the Joker in 1989&amp;lsquo;s Batman, among many other roles.Nicholson is one of only two actors who have been nominated for an Academy Award for acting in every decade from the 1960s to 2000s; the other is Michael Caine. He has won seven Golden Globe Awards, and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2001.

Let’s just say he lost his joie de vivre.<br />That’s why when I told people, "I’m working on a story about a form of therapy that involves placing electrodes on the head," I got a range of reactions — from looks of disbelief to downright aghast faces.<br />The therapy is called transcranial direct current stimulation or TDCS and it actually only involves about 1/400th of the amount of current applied in electroshock therapy. The amount is so small that some people don’t discern anything while others have described a slight tingling, itching or burning. In other words, no convulsing, foaming at the mouth or involuntary twitching of the body.<br />There is a lot of buzz about it lately in neuroscience circles with a growing number of studies using TDCS to treat a range of illnesses from schizophrenia, depression, to forms of brain damage caused by strokes.<br />TDCS works by placing a positive electrode and a negative electrode to specific parts of the brain. When the TDCS device is turned on, the current makes its way through the scalp, affecting the brain region beneath. The current is too small to actually make the neurons fire but, depending on the type of stimulation, it’s just enough to either enhance or diminish their natural ability to fire.<br />The therapeutic applications of TDCS are currently being tested in clinical trials around the world. Some of the most promising studies involve depression, including one in <a href='222.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:1'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-14.235004,-51.92528'>Brazil</a> , which is comparing the effects of Zoloft against TDCS. Researchers hope that TDCS as an “electroceutical” might be an alternative to pharmaceuticals which often have side effects. Or TDCS might be simply used on patients whose depression can’t be treated by medications.<br />But it’s not just those with serious mood disorders or mental illnesses who might benefit from TDCS. (Here’s the part in the conversation in which those who pooh-pooh the idea of zapping the brain usually sit up and take notice.) There are studies looking at how TDCS could help you lose weight .

He is generally considered one of the greatest painters and printmakers in European art history and the most important in Dutch history. His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age when Dutch Golden Age painting, although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative.Having achieved youthful success as a portrait painter, Rembrandt&amp;lsquo;s later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime, his reputation as an artist remained high, and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters. Rembrandt&amp;lsquo;s greatest creative triumphs are exemplified especially in his portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible.

The term Impressionism is derived from the title of his painting Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant).Claude Monet was born on 14 November 1840 on the 5th floor of 45 rue Laffitte, in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. He was the second son of Claude Adolphe Monet and Louise Justine Aubrée Monet, both of them second-generation Parisians. On 20 May 1841, he was baptized in the local parish church, Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, as Oscar-Claude, but his parents called him simply Oscar. In 1845, his family moved to Le Havre in Normandy.

In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Miró expressed contempt for conventional painting methods as a way of supporting bourgeois society, and famously declared an &quot;assassination of painting&quot; in favour of upsetting the visual elements of established painting.Born to the families of a goldsmith and a cabinet-maker, he grew up in the Barri Gòtic neighborhood of Barcelona.

    						The European Union (EU) /ˌjʊrəˈpiːənˈjuːnjən/ is an economic and political union or confederation of 27 member states which are located primarily in Europe. The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), formed by six countries in 1958. In the intervening years the EU has grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union under its current name in 1993. The latest amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.
The EU operates through a system of supranational independent institutions and intergovernmental negotiated decisions by the member states. Important institutions of the EU include the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, the European Council, the Court of Justice of the European Union, and the European Central Bank. The European Parliament is elected every five years by EU citizens.
The EU has developed a single market through a standardised system of laws which apply in all member states. Within the Schengen Area (which

    						Joan Miró i Ferrà (Catalan pronunciation: [ʒuˈam miˈɾo]) (April 20, 1893 – December 25, 1983) was a Spanish Catalan painter, sculptor, and ceramicist born in Barcelona. A museum dedicated to his work, the Fundació Joan Miró, was established in his birth city in 1975.
Earning international acclaim, his work has been interpreted as Surrealism, a sandbox for the subconscious mind, a re-creation of the childlike, and a manifestation of Catalan pride. In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Miró expressed contempt for conventional painting methods as a way of supporting bourgeois society, and famously declared an &quot;assassination of painting&quot; in favour of upsetting the visual elements of established painting.
Born to the families of a goldsmith and a cabinet-maker, he grew up in the Barri Gòtic neighborhood of Barcelona. His father was Miquel Miró Adzerias and his mother was Dolores Ferrà. He began drawing classes at the age of seven at a private school at Carrer del Regomir 13, a medieval mansion. In 1907 he enrolled at the fine art academy at La Llotja, to the dismay of his father. He studied at the Cercle Artístic de Sant Lluc and he had his first solo show in 1918 at the
