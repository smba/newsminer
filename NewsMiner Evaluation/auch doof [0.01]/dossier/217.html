This party ceased to exist as an organised political entity in the early 1760s, although it was used as a term of self-description by some political writers. A few decades later, a new Tory party would rise to establish a hold on government between 1783 and 1830, with William Pitt the Younger followed by Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool.The Earl of Liverpool was succeeded by fellow Tory Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, whose term included the Catholic Emancipation, which occurred mostly due to the election of Daniel O&amp;lsquo;Connell as a Catholic MP in Ireland.

He was appointed Acting Supreme Patriarch in 2005 due to the failing health of the incumbent Supreme Patriarch Nyanasamvara Suvaddhana. He is a monk of the Mahanikaya order, and is of Thai Chinese descent. His appointment provoked severe criticism from Luang Ta Maha Bua (of the Dhammayuttika Nikaya order) and Sondhi Limthongkul, who claimed that the appointment created two Supreme Patriarchs and contravened the royal prerogative of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. In 4 March 2005, Maha Bua even petitioned King Bhumibol Adulyadej to remove all of Kiaw&amp;lsquo;s royal titles.');">Somdet Kiaw</a> is the touristy one, Koh Pha Ngan the party one, and Koh Tao – which means turtle island – the chilled-out one. Or so the travel websites will tell you.<br />Koh Tao is a hangout for scuba divers. Dive-centres-cum-hotels line the shores, ferrying groups of tourists out to dive or snorkel the warm, beautiful blue waters. It is a world of dreadlocks, fruit smoothies and $2 gin-and-tonics as the sun sets.<br />‘There is a laissez-faire approach to planning law; some hotels and bars seem cobbled together from driftwood’. Photograph: Cathy Alexander<br />Alex Garland’s novel The Beach was set in this part of the world and the hedonistic full-moon parties on neighbouring Koh Pha Ngan are an international event.<br />Koh Tao has less of a hard-partying feel. Bars do line the main beach of Sai Ree, where the British backpackers died, and there are plenty of under-30s on the island (mainly Europeans and Brits). But those looking to cut loose head to Koh Pha Ngan.<br />The few roads the island has are poor, so it is quite hard to get around its 21 sq km. Isolated settlements and resorts pock the coastline. We took a water taxi to our hotel. The road was hard work; coconut shells had been used to fill potholes.<br />‘Koh Tao is a world of dreadlocks, fruit smoothies and $2 gin-and-tonics’.

There were protests against the coup and a curfew, but this has been lifted and the situation seems stable. There will now be fresh concerns for tourism operators that if foreign visitors fear attacks they will stop coming to the island or <a href='217.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:10'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='15.870032,100.992541'>Thailand</a> itself.<br />“This should not have happened in <a href='217.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:11'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='15.870032,100.992541'>Thailand</a>. It will affect our image in the eyes of international countries,” the prime minister, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, has said.<br />One factor that may affect the investigation into the deaths of the British backpackers is that Koh Tao island is not easy to get away from. It has no airport and just one port. Ferry trips, which are professionally run, often involve multiple legs and take hours. So anyone who left Koh Tao after the murders may well have been noticed by other passengers, ferry staff or taxi drivers.<br />Sign up for the Guardian Today<br />Our editors' picks for the day's top news and commentary delivered to your inbox each morning.<br />

    						Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond ( /ˈsæmənd/; born 31 December 1954) is a Scottish politician and current First Minister of Scotland. He became Scotland&#39;s fourth First Minister in May 2007. He is the Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), having served as Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Gordon.

Cameron studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Oxford, gaining a first class honours degree. He then joined the Conservative Research Department and became Special Adviser to Norman Lamont, and then to Michael Howard. He was Director of Corporate Affairs at Carlton Communications for seven years.
He was defeated in his first candidacy for Parliament at Stafford in 1997, but was elected in 2001 as the Member of Parliament for the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney. He was promoted to the Opposition front bench two years later, and rose rapidly to become head of policy co-ordination during the 2005 general election campaign. With a public image of a youthful, moderate candidate who would appeal to young voters, he won the Conservative leadership election in 2005.
In the 2010 general election held on 6 May, the Conservatives won 307 seats in a hung parliament. After five days of intense negotiations,

    						The European Union (EU) /ˌjʊrəˈpiːənˈjuːnjən/ is an economic and political union or confederation of 27 member states which are located primarily in Europe. The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), formed by six countries in 1958. In the intervening years the EU has grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union under its current name in 1993. The latest amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.
The EU operates through a system of supranational independent institutions and intergovernmental negotiated decisions by the member states. Important institutions of the EU include the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, the European Council, the Court of Justice of the European Union, and the European Central Bank. The European Parliament is elected every five years by EU citizens.
The EU has developed a single market through a standardised system of laws which apply in all member states. Within the Schengen Area (which

    						The Scottish National Party (SNP; Scottish Gaelic: Pàrtaidh Nàiseanta na h-Alba; Scots: Scottis Naitional Pairtie) is a social democratic political party in Scotland which campaigns for Scottish independence from the United Kingdom.
The SNP was founded in 1934, and has had continuous representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom since Winnie Ewing&#39;s groundbreaking victory at the 1967 Hamilton by-election.
In the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary election, the SNP became the largest political party in the Scottish Parliament for the first time, governing as a minority administration, with party leader Alex Salmond as First Minister of Scotland. At the 2011 Scottish Parliamentary election, the SNP won a landslide victory and became the first party to form a majority government in the Scottish Parliament since its resumption in 1999.
The SNP currently holds 6 of 59 Scottish seats in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and 2 of 6 Scottish seats in the European Parliament. The SNP is also currently the largest group in Scottish local government and, in coalition, forms 12 out of 32 local administrations.
The SNP was formed in 1934 through the merger of the National Party of

    						The Labour Party is a centre-left political party in the United Kingdom, and one of the two main British political parties along with the Conservative Party. The Labour Party was founded in 1900 and overtook the Liberal Party in general elections during the early 1920s, forming minority governments under Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 and 1929–1931. The party was in a wartime coalition from 1940 to 1945, after which it formed a majority government under Clement Attlee. Labour was also in government from 1964 to 1970 under Harold Wilson and from 1974 to 1979, first under Wilson and then James Callaghan.
The Labour Party was last in national government between 1997 and 2010 under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, beginning with a majority of 179, reduced to 167 in 2001 and 66 in 2005. Having won 258 seats in the 2010 general election, Labour is the Official Opposition. Labour has a minority government in the Welsh Assembly, is the main opposition party in the Scottish Parliament and has 13 MEPs in the European Parliament, sitting in the Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) group. The Labour Party is a member of the Socialist International and Party of European Socialists. The Party&#39;s current leader
