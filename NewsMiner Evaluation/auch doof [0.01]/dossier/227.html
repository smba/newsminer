The industrial fans the company produces in the southern German town of <a href='227.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:48'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='49.3408213,9.802786'>Mulfingen</a> are installed in supermarket refrigeration systems, hotel air-conditioners and computer servers worldwide.

This could create hundreds of jobs, but what is missing is "a decent road infrastructure to make our investment worthwhile," says Hundsdörfer. His trucks are forced to use Hollenbacher Steige, a crumbling road urgently in need of repaving. Often, trucks coming from opposite directions can't pass each other on the narrow road.<br />The road construction project would cost 3.48 million, but state and local governments have been hesitant to move forward for years, citing costs. For Hundsdörfer, the numbers simply don't add up. "We pay more in commercial tax each year than the road would cost to build." Now Hundsdörfer is considering the previously unthinkable: Why not build the logistics center abroad? Hundsdörfer wouldn't be alone in making that choice.<br />Decreased Industrial Investment<br />The German economy has shied away from investment for years.

His surviving works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and several other poems. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain&amp;lsquo;s Men, later known as the King&amp;lsquo;s Men.

					People rally to save Lake Burdur from drought ahead of ‘water fast’<br />Support is pouring in to save Lake Burdur from disappearing ahead of a weekend gathering that will include events to draw attention to the environmental problems of the area in what is being billed as a “water fast.”<br />Artists, politicians, scholars, activists, students and local farmers and villagers have sent videos to urge authorities to find a solution to a fast-paced drought that, according to experts, may lead to the extinction of the lake in a mere 20 years.

In the Roman-Byzantine Empire it was founded in 425 under the name of Pandidakterion. The original school was founded in 425 by Emperor Theodosius II with 31 chairs for law, philosophy, medicine, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, rhetoric and other subjects, 15 to Latin and 16 to Greek. The university existed until the 15th century.After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople a madrasa, a religious school, was established. An institution of higher education named the Darülfünun-i Osmani (&amp;lsquo;House of Sciences&amp;lsquo;) was created in 1863, but suppressed in 1871. Its first rector was Hasan Tahsini, regarded as one of the most important Ottoman scholars of the 19th century. In 1874 the Imperial University (Darülfünun-i Sultani) started to give lectures in law in French, but was closed in 1881.The Imperial University, now known as Darülfünun-i Shahane was refounded in 1900, with the departments');">Istanbul University</a> and is capable of travelling 500 kilometers on only four hours’ charge.<br />After traveling through the Turkish provinces of <a href='227.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:1'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='39.92077,32.85411'>Ankara</a>, <a href='227.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:2'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='41.292782,36.33128'>Samsun</a>, <a href='227.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:3'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='41.00145,39.7177999'>Trabzon</a>, <a href='227.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:4'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='39.908611,41.276944'>Erzurum</a>, Diyarbakır and <a href='227.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:6'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='37.06622,37.38332'>Gaziantep</a>, the car was driven through the Central Anatolian province of <a href='227.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:7'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='38.73122,35.478729'>Kayseri</a>’s main thoroughfare in front of curious onlookers to go on display as part of a nationwide tour on Sept. 22.<br />The car weighs 500 kilograms and can reach speeds of up to 130 kph, said Engin Topaloğlu, one of the <a href='227.html#' class='entity_link' onclick="changeContent('custom-widget-title','ITU School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering');changeContent('custom-widget-description','In 1926, the “Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering” was founded as part of the Science Faculty of Istanbul University (Istanbul Dar-ül Fünun).

					Desi Anwar: Caving and Tubing<br />By Desi Anwar on 08:08 pm Sep 23, 2014<br />Tags: Tourism , Writer's Block , yogyakarta<br />Next time you want to get away from it all and enjoy nature that is not your usual beach or mountain, try caving in <a href='227.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:2'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-6.2990454,107.3597804'>Gunung Kidul Regency</a> district in the southeastern part of the <a href='227.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:3'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-7.7970684,110.3705267'>Yogyakarta</a> province. The area is known for its dryness and difficulty in getting water for irrigation as it is in a karst region. However, the karst also gives the area its unique characteristics, with many caves and underground rivers with pristine clear waters.<br />I decide to visit some of these caves. The first is the Pindul Cave, Gua Pindul, which is around an hour-and-a-halve drive from <a href='227.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:4'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-7.7970684,110.3705267'>Yogyakarta</a> city, which, since a few years ago, you can explore while floating on rubber body rafts made from the inner tubes of a large tire, in an activity called tubing.<br />Before this ingenious tourism activity, the caves in this area were practically inaccessible. Now, tubing is one of the most popular activities especially for school children and local tourists as, I shall soon find out, it’s extremely fun and safe.<br />My driver and local guide Aris takes me to a tour operator where, after paying around $3, we’re kitted out in life jackets (a must) and given our black rubber lifesaver. A few meters further, we are at the edge of the underground river that leads to the mouth of Pindul Cave.<br />The cave itself is around 350 meters long, with a water depth that varies from five meters to 12 meters, and a ceiling of around four meters. It was home to swallows and bats, though nowadays the constant stream of visitors have forced them to seek a new home elsewhere, though it is easy to see the traces of bat urine decorating the cave ceiling.<br />We wade in the river, sit back on our raft and begin our 45-minute journey into the underground darkness, our bottoms immediately wet. Reaching the inside of the cave, the light dims and I promptly lose my sunglasses, which sink to the bottom of the six-meter deep water.<br />The cave has three zones, each with increasing darkness. The last part is called the Eternal Darkness zone, because it is, well, really dark. As we float on the river towards the exit of the cave, the place lit only by our guides’ torches, one can really appreciate the beauty of this ancient grotto with pick marked walls and enormous stalactites hanging down from the ceiling, as well as stalagmites, reaching up from the bottom of the river, as if in some enormous and dark cathedral.<br />This cave tubing experience is often continued with a trip down the river Oyo, or Kali Oyo, a few minutes’ drive away in the back of a pick-up truck. As I’m already wet, I decide to be a sport and pay an extra $4 for the next adventure.<br />The road to the river is bumpy but scenic, passing through hectares of cajuput plantation. I roll some leaves against my fingers and the familiar aroma of cajuput oil used in ointments to cure all sorts of Indonesians’ ailments, especially masuk angin, or catching wind, wafts to my nose.<br />It is still the dry season and the river is not too deep nor the current too rapid, making the water a clear, emerald green hue the likes of which one would never see in <a href='227.html#' class='entity_link' id='map-navigation:5'class='map-navigation' data-zoom='8' data-position='-6.2087634,106.845599'>Jakarta</a>.

    						Jacques Balmat, called le Mont Blanc (1762–1834) was a mountaineer, a Savoyard mountain guide, and born a citizen of the Kingdom of Sardinia.
He was born in the Chamonix valley. A chamois hunter and collector of crystals, Balmat completed the first ascent of Mont Blanc with physician Michel-Gabriel Paccard on August 8, 1786. For this feat, the king of Sardinia gave him the honorary title le Mont Blanc.
Balmat and Paccard&#39;s ascent of Mont Blanc was a major accomplishment in the early history of mountaineering. C. Douglas Milner wrote &quot;The ascent itself was magnificent; an amazing feat of endurance and sustained courage, carried through by these two men only, unroped and without ice axes, heavily burdened with scientific equipment and with long iron-pointed batons. The fortunate weather and a moon alone ensured their return alive.&quot; 
Eric Shipton wrote &quot;Theirs was an astounding achievement of courage and determination, one of the greatest in the annals of mountaineering. It was accomplished by men who were not only on unexplored ground but on a route that all the guides believed to be impossible.&quot; 
Gaston Rébuffat praised Balmat&#39;s climbing abilities, describing him as &quot;This man,

    						Petróleo Brasileiro or Petrobras is a semi-public Brazilian multinational energy corporation headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is the largest company in the Southern Hemisphere by market capitalization and the largest in Latin America measured by 2011 revenues.
Petrobras was founded in 1953. While the company ceased to be Brazil&#39;s legal monopolist in the oil industry in 1997, it remains a significant oil producer, with output of more than 2 million barrels (320,000 m) of oil equivalent per day, as well as a major distributor of oil products. The company also owns oil refineries and oil tankers. Petrobras is a world leader in development of advanced technology from deep-water and ultra-deep water oil production.
In September 2010 Petrobras conducted the largest share sale in history, when US$72.8 billion worth of shares in the company were sold on the BM&amp;F Bovespa stock exchange. Upon the sale Petrobras immediately became the fourth-largest company in the world measured by market capitalisation.
Petrobras controls significant oil and energy assets in 18 countries in Africa, North America, South America, Europe and Asia. These holdings as well as properties in Brazil give

    						Aberdeen /æbərˈdiːn/ (Scots: Aiberdeen  listen (help·info); Scottish Gaelic: Obar Dheathain [ˈopər ˈʝɛhɪn]) is Scotland&#39;s third most populous city, one of Scotland&#39;s 32 local government council areas and the United Kingdom&#39;s 29th most populous city, with an official population estimate of 220,420.
Nicknames include the Granite City, the Grey City and the Silver City with the Golden Sands. During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries, Aberdeen&#39;s buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite, which can sparkle like silver due to their high mica contents. The city has a long, sandy coastline. Since the discovery of North Sea oil in the 1970s, other nicknames have been the Oil Capital of Europe or the Energy Capital of Europe. The area around Aberdeen has been settled since at least 8,000 years ago, when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers Dee and Don.
Aberdeen received Royal Burgh status from King David I (1124–53), transforming the city economically. The city&#39;s two universities, the University of Aberdeen, founded in 1495, and The Robert Gordon University, which was awarded university status in 1992, make Aberdeen the educational centre of the north-east.

    						The North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO ( /ˈneɪtoʊ/ NAY-toh; French: Organisation du traité de l&#39;Atlantique Nord (OTAN)), also called the (North) Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party. NATO&#39;s headquarters are in Brussels, Belgium, one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO&#39;s Partnership for Peace, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programs. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the world&#39;s defence spending.
For its first few years, NATO was not much more than a political association. However, the Korean War galvanized the member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two U.S. supreme commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, which formed in 1955. The

    						Dilma Vana Rousseff (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈdʒiwmɐ χuˈsɛf] born 14 December 1947) is the 36th and current President of Brazil. She is the first woman to hold the office. Prior to that, in 2005, she was also the first woman to become Chief of Staff to the President of Brazil, appointed by then President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
The daughter of a Bulgarian entrepreneur, Rousseff was raised in an upper middle class household in Belo Horizonte. She became a socialist during her youth, and following the 1964 coup d&#39;état joined various left-wing and Marxist urban guerrilla groups that fought against the military dictatorship. Rousseff was captured and jailed between 1970 and 1972 and reportedly tortured.
After her release, Rousseff rebuilt her life in Porto Alegre with Carlos Araújo, who would be her partner for 30 years. Both helped found the Democratic Labour Party (PDT) in Rio Grande do Sul, participating in several of the party&#39;s electoral campaigns. She became the Secretary of the Treasury of the city of Porto Alegre in the Alceu Collares administration, and later the Secretary of Energy of the State of Rio Grande do Sul under both Collares and Olívio Dutra administrations.
